Teaching programming has always been a challenge given the lack of experience, understanding and knowledge students in schools generally have about what is involved and what it means to be studying "IT". It hasn't been helped by a lack of robust curriculum in most states and territories in Australia. With the recent endorsement of the Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies, most states and territories have implementation timelines as early as 2017, and this means that teachers (and those who want to support them in their classrooms) now have an obligation to deliver ambitious, engaging and rigorous learning activities in their classrooms. Having been in the enviable situation of being supported and encouraged to design and implement innovative computer science curricula for students in years 6-12, I'll be sharing the reasons why I choose to use Python as my primary teaching language in high school, and identify the tips, tricks and traps teachers need to watch out for when using it as the basis for learning not just programming skills, but computational thinking more generally. This includes an explanation of the importance of a project-driven approach, and demonstration of the techniques I use and projects my students work on in class.

Bruce welcome thanks Nick and hopefully

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,769
audio is all good sounds that way so I'm

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,420
here to tell you a little bit about my

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,880
experience of Python in the classroom

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,680
over the last ten plus years to give you

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
a little bit of an idea as to where I am

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,619
and who I come from beyond that little

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,570
bio I am a teacher primarily I do a

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,730
little bit of development still actively

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,990
at school writing mostly things for the

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,539
school to deal with a lot of our

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,880
internal processes that are grossly

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,969
inefficient and used systems from the

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,469
dark ages and I've got a interest in

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,270
curriculum and for that reason put my

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,590
hand up to be involved in the writing of

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,710
this training curriculum and was lucky

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,860
enough to be a part of that so what I

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,180
want to do before we get started is talk

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,070
a little bit about the educational

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,360
landscape as it is now for teachers in

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,559
schools this is probably something

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,090
you're very familiar with for the

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,860
outside of your jurisdiction there may

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,870
be some things you're not completely on

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,789
top of but far the people in the room

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,530
this may give you a little bit of

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,570
background in context that'll help

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,820
throughout the other sessions that I

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,280
presented today so I'll try to get

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,040
through this nice and quick now one of

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,229
the problems that computing curriculums

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,229
generally in Australia I've faced is

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,759
that often they're very very dated the

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,740
behind where the industry needs to be

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,720
they haven't been kept up to date for a

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,460
number of reasons some of it has to do

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,350
with politics some of it to do we teach

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,710
your expertise and the lack of that

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,740
that's present in schools but the great

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,509
thing is things are changing all right

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,189
there is an image problem that we're

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,590
going to have to counter the idea that

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,720
curriculum in schools is very much about

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,000
how to use the office suite effectively

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,299
or how to manipulate images in Photoshop

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,399
a lot of that is no longer the case but

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,799
a lot of parents and a lot of community

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,210
members aren't completely up to date

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,170
with the changes that are happening

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,909
right now so the digital technologies

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,040
curriculum which has been endorsed by

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,439
all of the educational jurisdictions in

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,350
Australia is built on five key concepts

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,630
the one that underlies everything is

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,879
abstraction abstraction and

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,370
decomposition and related ideas and on

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,650
top of that we've got the idea of data

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,430
properties of data sources of data how

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,590
represented interpreted and analyzed we

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,769
also have algorithms the idea that

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,150
definition specification design and

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,980
implementation of solutions to problems

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,069
is a really really important part of

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,840
learning in the digital technologies

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,730
digital systems such as the hardware and

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,470
software that we use networks in the

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,680
internet and finally the role that

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,569
people play on the way the systems are

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,700
used and the impact systems have on

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,920
their cell society so that interactions

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,120
an impact layer is something that is is

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,370
evident not just in the digital

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,599
technologies curriculum area but also in

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,269
the other areas of the Australian

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,340
Curriculum as well so as you can see the

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,260
digital technologies now is very very

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,840
different to what it may have been

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,639
treated in schools generally across the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,829
country and particularly in recent areas

00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,720
where I city is generally seen as a tool

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,849
for learning and as a result a lot of

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,230
the curriculum around ICT has changed

00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,620
and has become a little bit more about

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,540
using tools rather than creating with it

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,750
so where are we at with implementation

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,049
well I'm pleased to say that the a.c.t

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,239
where I'm from as well as Victoria where

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,040
most of you are probably from have

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,660
decided and agreed to adopt the

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,949
curriculum from 2016 and they're joined

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,410
by South Australia in the Northern

00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,199
Territory in that Queens layers not too

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,579
far behind and has said that 2017 is

00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:38,040
going to be the year of adoption across

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:40,049
the board there they are and in 2018 we

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,699
expect to see almost everyone else join

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:46,470
us now New South Wales have recently

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,659
released the shaping paper that sort of

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,220
starts to define what the syllabus will

00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,079
look like down there but being the

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,909
largest jurisdiction in the southern

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,930
hemisphere for education it's no

00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,639
surprise things are going to probably

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,260
take a little bit longer in New South

00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,879
Wales but hopefully they won't be too

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,870
far behind the rest of us and we'll be

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,879
able to put another color up there so my

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,169
experience okay because I think it's

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,180
important to understand where I'm coming

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,650
from and and to give you a sense of the

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,690
kinds of challenges that teachers have

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,320
faced and some of the solutions that we

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,060
can all use and might be in classrooms

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,739
first of all I put this slide together

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,900
originally it said teaching programming

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,419
isn't easy and then I revised it because

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,590
I honestly believe that there are so

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,410
many challenges involved

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,760
in the profession of teaching that it's

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,199
important that I emphasize that for

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,720
anyone who's not teaching programming

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,010
you've still got a mountain of

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,960
challenges that you've got to deal with

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,850
but I'm going to focus specifically on

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,590
the programming side of things all right

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,120
and I'm going to talk about some of the

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,370
reasons I found that it hasn't been an

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,250
easy thing to do but the fact that i

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,979
believe it's getting much much simpler

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,820
so some of the reasons for that is that

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,290
generally programming when it's

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,110
introduced to students is very very

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,350
unfamiliar most students have never seen

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,750
programming before when they're 15 16 17

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,340
it's generally not introduced in schools

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,900
before that so as a result it's hard all

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,639
right when you compare it to the fact

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,770
that if you do an English class or a

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,139
history class when you're 16 you've been

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,510
doing that for at least 10 to 12 minutes

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,639
all right it's something that you at

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,820
least understand it conceptually is not

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,440
new when you're throwing what is

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,380
effectively another language at someone

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,229
all right it's very very difficult but

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,570
what I like to think is that that's

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,160
going to change in your 11 and 12 has

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,440
been a real problem for us in particular

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,780
because it's high stakes at that point

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,580
and students are aiming to get the

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,800
absolute highest school that they can as

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,270
far as an 8r is concerned and what that

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,220
means is that it's easier for them to

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,960
drop out of the subject that's hard and

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,360
do something that's easier even if it's

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,190
not stimulating or interesting so that

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,470
they maximize their 8r for university

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,210
entrance and it's unfortunate but that's

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,510
the reality of the situation that i

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,490
think is gradually changing the other

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,680
thing is for those students who have had

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,130
experience in IT in schools it's been

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,110
pretty rubbish and as a result they're

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,970
not interested in doing it later on if

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,460
you have a really bad experience in an

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,470
IT class in u7 the last thing you're

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,860
going to do is sign up for another four

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,080
years from use 9 through to 12 the other

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,490
thing is that a lot of parents and the

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,289
community generally don't understand

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,560
what the expectations of IT curricula

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,479
are so you're not going to as a parent

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,310
say to your child hey get into it it's

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,220
really great it's really exciting if

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,530
your memory of it was was pretty dry

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,460
pretty average if what you've heard from

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:40,110
people who did it is pretty rubbish

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,139
and as a result we actually need to

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,120
address that issue as a profession and

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,039
as a community and I think there's a lot

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,660
of work going on in that space and in

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,039
fact even things like the National

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,120
Innovation science agenda that's come

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,770
out from the federal government is

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,630
really pushing education before front

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,520
again so hopefully the conversation that

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,030
happens around this nationally is going

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,789
to be really really positive so where

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,250
did I start when i graduated in 2005

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,530
started at a high school in the acct and

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,060
there was one bit of programming in our

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,250
curriculum it was an internets and

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,099
intranets unit and it was JavaScript

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,550
client side make a quiz in a web browser

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,440
and it basically involved you taking the

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,300
code that the teacher gave you and then

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,860
changing the text in the questions and

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,349
changing the answers right and then

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,789
people were able to essentially do the

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,710
same quiz the answers were always in the

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,570
same spot unless you were smart enough

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,150
as a kid to work out how the answer was

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,650
determined and you know you got a knife

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,669
the assignment because people could

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,479
answer all the questions right in the

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,940
quiz so bit rubbish I decided that that

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,490
was all going to change and so in the

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,590
following year we beefed it up a little

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,440
bit we still had students doing my tea

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,180
for the first time ever in New nine but

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,940
this time we added some server side

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,099
stuff to the course as well we improved

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,900
what we were expecting around the

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,050
JavaScript side of things and we

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,340
introduced PHP as a server-side language

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,560
but what we found was students would

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,810
just jump online find code that did what

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,060
they needed to do and drop it into their

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,650
websites and the other thing that they

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,330
did is if they couldn't find code that

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,919
did exactly what they wanted to do they

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,750
just change without doing so that it did

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,789
what the code in any way all right so

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,409
there's no real problem solving involved

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,120
in that it's basically a treasure hunt

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:22,380
to find out how you can find bits and

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,150
pieces that will fit together to do

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,080
something that kind of resembles what

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,930
you were planning to do in the first

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,969
place so I didn't like that and we

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,760
reviews that me revise that we tried to

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,529
prevent it but it was very very hard to

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,539
make a change in terms of that attitude

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,250
so we wanted to expand their offerings

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,659
we were starting to get a little bit

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,219
more interest in the courses because

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,899
there was a little bit more to them than

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,060
just you know making websites and

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:48,270
Dreamweaver so we introduced an

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,400
object-oriented course and the initial

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,779
decision was to use Java that was what

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,050
the expertise at the school

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,829
was other than myself and you know what

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,019
it was a bad idea it appealed to

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,699
students who were interested in it who

00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,170
were keen to sort of do the additional

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,629
research to understand what was going on

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,040
but a lot of students saw how much code

00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,350
was involved to print a simple message

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,269
on the screen and all of these extra

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,509
words and things that didn't even seem

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,129
to be necessary and simply switched off

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,809
and it was really really hard for us to

00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,459
maintain interest particularly with the

00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,959
students who we're kind of doing it

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,699
because they thought they might be

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,990
interested but didn't actually know what

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:31,499
was involved in actually programming so

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,759
this'll had to change and in 2009 we

00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:35,939
decided that we were going to adopt

00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,410
Python and use the ncess challenge well

00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,300
put together by the University of Sydney

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,220
as our primary means of introducing

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,939
programming and it worked really really

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,949
well in fact it's probably been the most

00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,139
successful transition I've ever done in

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,749
terms of the classroom we were able to

00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,579
do it at year 8 9 and 10 level the

00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:55,829
e-rate struggled initially the challenge

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,540
only had one level early on and it was

00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,519
probably pitched a little bit too high

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,379
for those students but over time the

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
ncess challenge introduced additional

00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,000
streams there was additional scaffolding

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,709
added to the notes to the questions and

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,139
as a result we were able to use the

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,519
ncess challenge exclusively for all of

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,019
our introductory programming courses

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,879
regardless of the year level students

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,879
were in and that use Python which was

00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,769
great so we shared that success with

00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,899
every other school in the acct through

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,629
the professional association of teachers

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,360
tell me and as a result we got more

00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,980
interest has it been adopted generally

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,860
across all schools in OCT i wouldn't go

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,350
that far to say yes but we do have more

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,209
schools now who at least picking up

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,410
Python as the language because they've

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,259
been impressed with the ease with which

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,420
students learn it they're not always

00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,579
using the N CSS challenge there are a

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,639
number of reasons why they sort of

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,170
choosing other tools but essentially

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,850
that increased visibility of Python in

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,189
schools in the acct has made a big

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,769
difference to the quality of programming

00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:57,899
computer science education tell me so I

00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,759
can go and college which is to heat the

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,959
school that I'm at Python is now our

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,699
primary language we use it for

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,880
everything with the exception of our

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,380
embedded systems unit so I'm really

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,200
to see what's going on in the micro

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,940
Python space bit later on today but

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,100
we've got the highest IT enrollments for

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,170
any secondary college in the acct across

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,140
all private and public sectors so we get

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,600
170 students in year 11 and 12 alone and

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,330
we've got a school of about a thousand

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,700
year 11 and 12 students so yeah that's

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,940
not bad if a fifth of the population is

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,190
enrolled in an IT course we must be

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,840
doing something right okay we're really

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,730
excited about that we're looking to grow

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,860
it further it also means that we can

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,590
maintain two full-time plus an executive

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,030
teacher just for IT teaching which is

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,490
great because it means that we can

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,690
attract the people who are keen and who

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,190
have the knowledge of skills they need

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,030
to be able to deliver on what is a very

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,410
demanding curriculum these are the

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,970
reasons we've essentially went with

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,170
Python in the end and I think their

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,000
reasons that a lot of people in here

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,140
would be familiar with so I'm not going

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,510
to spend a whole lot of time on this

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,760
slide other than to say that the one

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,260
that's probably been the biggest that's

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,240
had the biggest impact for us is the

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,650
friendliness of the language the fact

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,780
that it's got a really sort of simple

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,580
syntax and it does have a lot of

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,590
similarities with pseudo code that other

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,660
students may have seen before through

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,640
their other their other IT courses and

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,560
that's particularly important for us in

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,690
a secondary college where a lot we only

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,940
see students for two years they come to

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,920
us from your 10 from a number of

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,450
different schools in the area we don't

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,700
know what their prior experience has

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,960
been so we have to start at a point

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,850
where we've got students that have

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,440
literally done nothing before and other

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,300
students who have completed the advanced

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,950
stream of the NGSS challenge for the

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,930
past couple of years and we need to

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,330
challenge students in both of those

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,830
categories and everywhere in between so

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,240
the fact that it's friendly and easy

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,940
means that we can on board beginners

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,440
very very quickly and those that have

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,120
experience in programming even if it's

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,340
not Python can make the transition to a

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,050
new language very very quickly and then

00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,970
can get actually spend their time in the

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,420
classroom investigating more interesting

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,170
and engaging things but I have to say

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,490
it's not you know perfect there are

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,590
obstacles and challenges that we're

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,240
still facing and the three big ones for

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,790
us have been around first of all

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,620
graphics and games if students want to

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,500
create something from scratch it's not

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,310
as easy to do in that's in Python when

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,510
compared to other languages

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,160
doesn't mean there are platforms out

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,560
there and in fact we use pygame quite

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,690
extensively to do that but it's not as

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,060
easy as it might be for them to say fire

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,740
up unity or Unreal Engine and get stuck

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,660
into games through storyboarding or

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,490
something like that so i guess i just

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,839
wanted to sort of emphasize that that is

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,790
still a challenge that we're continuing

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,290
to work through integrating with

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,080
peripherals or making use of external

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,190
peripherals and our keyboard and mouse

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,020
can be a challenge depending on the

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,940
nature of it sometimes it is sometimes

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,380
it's not and so students are sort of

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,660
reluctant if it's not something that

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,130
they can be confident is just going to

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,600
work for them like most of the other

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,630
things that they're dealing with in the

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
language and bundling applications up so

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,020
that they can be used on any machine

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,760
anywhere else is he's also a real

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,460
challenge for us and again there are

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,870
packages that do that but the

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,210
effectiveness with which they do it is

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,000
always a challenge and students like to

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,800
sort of use these sort of obscure little

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,600
modules and things that they find online

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,220
that kind of do what they want to do and

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,990
I get really familiar with that and then

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,430
they forget to tell you when they submit

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,470
your assignment that you need to go and

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,610
install it all right and so you have to

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,260
spend the first a little bit of time

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,700
finding out which modules you need to

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,190
get and putting them on so I mean

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,130
they're not big things but what we find

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,170
is that experience solves a lot of them

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,210
students in your 12 can cope with this

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,610
quite comfortably the students in your

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,570
11 earlier on in the course do struggle

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:42,120
a little bit so what have I learned from

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,860
all of this right that's ultimately well

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,089
I think the most important thing that I

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,600
need to address through the talk today

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,640
so there are five points that I want to

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,500
highlight in the first is this keep

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,530
things as painless as possible for

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,560
students all right now how do you do

00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,790
that you teach the fundamentals

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,190
explicitly and you make sure that

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,230
students understand what's going on the

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,030
one big trap with python is that it's

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,709
easy to do lots of things that kind of

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,839
really understanding exactly what you're

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,600
doing right because things can be done

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,390
pretty easily but when students are

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
trying to manipulate something inside an

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,500
array or a list and they decide to use a

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,790
for loop and they think they're writing

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,490
over the top of their variable but then

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,430
it doesn't change understanding what is

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,380
actually going on makes a big difference

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,340
not just at that point in terms of their

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,620
learning

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,120
but also in terms of any future learning

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,710
and projects and programs that they're

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
going to work on later on because they

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,540
know what to expect and they know what

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,850
kinds of solutions are not going to work

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,930
so there are few tools we used to do

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,460
that I've mentioned the entities

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,170
challenge and Glock learning

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,030
subscriptions are standard to every

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,040
student that comes into our school we

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,450
sign them up we pay for it that's part

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,610
of their on the school fees and we're a

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,200
government school so your fees are

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,920
optional for us but we build it into our

00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,990
budget is one of our few ite expenses we

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,460
also use the interactive Python website

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,080
there's an online textbook but how to

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,280
think like a computer scientist textbook

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,560
that a lot of people were probably

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,740
familiar with the entire thing is online

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,580
and has a holy bit interactive some

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,190
projects and things that you can work

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,080
through so will often direct students to

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,910
though to activities in there to support

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,700
the stuff that they're doing on the got

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,860
platform in addition to that code

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,600
Academy provides some really easy sort

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,610
of drill and practice additional support

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,020
for students who maybe get through the

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,510
stuff that we've got access to through

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,550
the other platforms very very quickly so

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,990
it's just in a way that we can sort of

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,400
direct people will direct students

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:39,330
somewhere else for a little bit more

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:42,480
kind of practice and drill Coursera is

00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,810
great we rely on the sort of intro level

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,880
university courses to give students a

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,500
grounding in ideas and concepts that

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,050
they might use in their projects in you

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,370
12 so we do rely heavily on that for

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,530
that and in fact there's a there's an

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,690
entire course on there that covers a lot

00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,220
of the principles of computational an

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,130
hour with me thinking that we rely on

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,660
quite heavily and imply game we use for

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,840
a lot of our graphics and play game

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,030
stuff so and and game related stuff so

00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,890
um yeah the great thing about this is

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,740
that the majority are very very easily

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,240
accessible there grok is effectively

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,770
free for our students so as far as

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,600
students are concerned all of this is

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,400
free to them and they can access it and

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,850
and the quality of resources generally

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,280
is really really good so once you've

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,770
taught them the fundamentals the thing

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,430
to emphasize with any project that you

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,900
set is the thinking right because they

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,820
learn very quickly that they can code

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,950
and they can code pretty easily in

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,360
Python right but when you give them a

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,070
new task if the first thing they do is

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,049
sit down and try to bash out an answer

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,369
they're going to create a rubbish answer

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,989
all right and they're gonna have to go

00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:47,429
back and rewrite their code and rewrite

00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:49,080
their code and rewrite their code and

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,669
then they complain that we haven't given

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,309
them enough time the deadlines are too

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,169
tight and goes from there I tell them

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,340
they're wrong of course because I set

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,369
the task and I know how much time it

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,080
should take you so what we do is we make

00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,690
sure we really emphasize that whole

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,340
thinking process and the way we do that

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,230
I can go on college is we've given them

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,090
a kind of framework with which to think

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,759
about a problem and it's modeled on a

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,619
design thinking framework which sort of

00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,149
coincides nicely with the Australian

00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,070
Curriculum and the expectation of the

00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:19,139
technologies learning area is sort of

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,850
built around three types of thinking

00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,609
systems thinking design thinking and

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,489
computational thinking and you can see

00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:28,499
there that we emphasize a lot of sort of

00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:32,759
working to get us and collaboration some

00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:34,769
active kind of group engagement with any

00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,139
of the activities that we do that's a

00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:39,840
fairly sort of standard introductory

00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:42,950
sort of lesson when we're introducing a

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,269
new project or concept that we use I

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,369
like the fact that we don't have a lot

00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,869
of walls we don't have a focal point in

00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:53,269
our teaching space but i'll come back to

00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:55,559
the environment a little bit later on so

00:18:53,269 --> 00:19:02,399
relevance is another important factor

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:03,809
right wing your tea understanding of

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:05,820
what's going on under the hood is clear

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,679
to students but when you're giving them

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,059
a project it's not enough to say oh

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,249
you're just going to write you know a

00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,960
hundred while loops to make sure you

00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,970
understand how while it works right

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,340
that's the old sort of mass text book

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,720
drill and practice idea and we know how

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,730
effective that's been with engaging

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,980
students in mathematics who aren't

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,509
really interested in it right so one of

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,769
the things that we really emphasize is

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,690
that the projects that students are work

00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:29,100
not working on have to be relevant they

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,659
have to be interesting problems for

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,269
students and that's not going to be

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,039
consistent and then in common for all

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,840
students so you have to be flexible in

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,190
terms of how we set these things up so

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,960
these are some examples of student

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,489
projects that have put in put together I

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,259
actually have a session on sunday where

00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,609
I'm going to showcase a lot of these so

00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,730
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on

00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:50,489
them now but games in pygame a common

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,999
data visualization for a data set that

00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:55,619
they choose this is a pathfinding tool

00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,320
that was built on the basis of sort of

00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,870
upload

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,990
maps that you create so it's not

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,820
predefined in any way this is a

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,350
simulation for a mechatronics project

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,960
that a couple of students are launching

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,120
this is how they're going to determine

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,039
where they're going to be recovering the

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,370
payload from their high-altitude balloon

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,830
that they're launching yes this is a

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,389
parody predictive text and parody text

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,960
generator that a student built using

00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:26,289
markov chains this one here is a text

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,029
summarization tool that uses tf-idf and

00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,190
k-means clustering to work out what the

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,070
most important aspects of a published

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,500
article are and this is a handwriting

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,480
recognition tool which is a trained

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,029
neural network to determine exactly

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,370
what's going on it I mean this wasn't

00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:43,960
exactly accurate in terms of that he

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,909
trained it with his handwriting and my

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,289
handwriting on a touchpad is clearly far

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:51,669
worse than users right so that's just an

00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,620
example of the kinds of projects they're

00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:56,049
working they're all interesting for the

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,730
students involved right and we haven't

00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,919
been too prescriptive in terms of what

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,960
they need to be doing the arm

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,360
collaboration is key right make it

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,460
social it's particularly engaging for

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,649
girls this way right one of the real

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,090
challenges that a lot of teachers have

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,950
with engaging girls in programming is

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,110
that ends can be a little bit

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,299
isolationist and the classroom can be

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,399
dominated by guys but if you give them

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,259
opportunities to collaborate if you can

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,059
give them opportunities to lead that

00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,559
discussion to make it very very clear to

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,539
others in the group that they are just

00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,059
as knowledgeable if not more so than

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,009
others you can help counter some of the

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,299
stigma associated with that so we do

00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:33,279
that with our environment this is our

00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:35,350
new teaching space the one you saw last

00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,139
on the other slide was last year space

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,090
as you can see with bench seating some

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,590
smaller seating we've got a bench up

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,870
atop the tables at the back have a

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,429
whiteboard surface that we use students

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,000
to sort of collaborate on the whiteboard

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,320
space the TVs are all open access so

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,879
it's not restricted to teachers and

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,990
students use that for collaborative

00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:57,580
discussion and code just some shots of

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,779
students working together there the

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,940
other thing that we've also done is

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:02,649
we've provided plenty of space around

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,629
the classroom for them to do their

00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:06,700
planning and brainstorming as well so

00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:08,289
that's some of the brainstorming work

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,669
the students working on the UM the

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,279
sea-mew

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,749
project we're doing so the fact that

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,830
they've got all of that access means

00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,570
that they're not restricted to a single

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,700
space in their classroom and they can

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,529
get out there and they can use the

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,119
environment the best way for the

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,940
particular aspect of the problem they're

00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,889
working on and finally keep the

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,139
project's open-ended all right and

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:29,940
that's probably a little bit obvious

00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,649
through the variation that I've provided

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,929
in some of those other student examples

00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:35,549
but even for the simpler tasks that we

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,159
set for students at an introductory

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,109
stage of the course we follow a standard

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,059
framework that ensures that there's

00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,739
something in it for everyone and that

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,929
there is no sort of endpoint that you

00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:47,549
hit you know three days in if you if

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,679
you're all over it that means that

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:52,080
you're kind of done and you disengage

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,519
for the rest of the time so we get them

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,169
to document any of the code that we

00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,549
provide to them as a means of making

00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,609
sure they understand what's going on

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:03,330
already then the odd the goal is to

00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:05,129
improve the existing code then expand it

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,499
and then redefine aspects of it that you

00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:09,239
want to change all right and the good

00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,549
thing about this is everyone can get

00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:12,929
through the first two parts even if some

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,940
require quite a bit of teacher support

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,700
to do it and the bottom is where that

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,649
opens sort of unstructured free-for-all

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,749
learning happens and that's a really

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:23,070
really great model to use if you're

00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,379
looking at a way of sort of thinking

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,909
about how you might structure tasks for

00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:31,889
IT projects so I asked a couple of my

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,600
students why did you like learning

00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:35,669
python right and these were the

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,859
responses i got from them now cat came

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,720
to us in the middle of year 11 right

00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,889
she's the one who wrote the parody text

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,289
generator and the text prediction

00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:46,320
software she wrote that having done

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:48,269
programming for nine months right so

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,929
this is a student who came to a sort of

00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:53,730
her late but was sort of really enthused

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,899
by and she liked the fact that she could

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,909
just pick it up and run with it very

00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,139
very quickly all right I asked her if

00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:01,049
she's been learning Haskell at

00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:02,549
university this semester and one of the

00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,989
things that she said is there's a whole

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,919
heap of stuff on me first of all was a

00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,809
completely different way of thinking

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,580
about programming right so so there's a

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,830
challenge there already but when you

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,299
compare it to how easy it was to pick up

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,489
something like Python right there's a

00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,859
whole heap of stuff going on it that you

00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:18,509
sort of don't need to understand to be

00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,280
able to do things but if you understand

00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:21,930
it makes it

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,400
when she was we using Python she felt

00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,080
like everything that she learned was

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,870
very easy to understand and it was

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,790
pretty severe front and obvious a daemon

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,860
another one of our students he started

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,680
programming in your eight and he found

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,660
that the fact that the code kind of gets

00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,760
out of the way because the syntax is so

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,650
easy meant that all of the learning that

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,750
he actually did was around the problem

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,250
solving right thinking about how you're

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,770
going to come up with your solution and

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,540
so that's set him up really really well

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,430
for future projects that he built and he

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,980
was the one who built the umpire finding

00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,950
tool for custom maps right and they use

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,210
computer vision to scan the the map that

00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,010
you upload to work out where the various

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:03,540
nodes are and then they use a star for

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:05,880
pathfinding so this is the too long

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,250
didn't read version of my presentation

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,050
right the five key things that I think

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,140
you need to keep in mind when you're

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,550
going to teach Python successfully

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,860
emphasize the fundamentals right don't

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,990
assume them teach them be explicit about

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,340
it explicit teaching has a role and

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,810
making sure that the fundamentals are

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,900
understood is a really important part of

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,870
that emphasize the thinking because well

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,340
design code is good I mean it's good for

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,530
many many reasons right but it means

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,600
that it's reusable and it means that

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,190
when it comes time for you to solve

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,920
different problems you're going to be

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,810
well grounded keep things interesting

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,060
right because if it's not interesting

00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:45,620
you're gonna lose them and make sure

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,880
that that's designed in your tasks

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,440
encourage rivalry but make it friendly

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,930
if you can get rid of any sort of

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,820
antagonistic kind of competition in your

00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,350
classroom and get everyone working

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,940
towards the same goal you'll actually

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,770
get better results across the board and

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,840
students need to understand that even in

00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,610
a competitive environment that friendly

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,980
rivalry makes a huge difference so

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,080
collaboration is key to that and finally

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,240
don't restrict creativity right

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,370
programming is as much as an art as it

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,630
is a tool to solving problems and it's

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,180
important that students can see that

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,040
really really early on so that's it for

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,580
me I'm happy to take questions in the

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,140
last time that I've got hopefully you

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,140
enjoyed it thank you

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,350
thank you very much Bruce and yes we do

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:34,260
have time for questions so put your hand

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,840
up and I'll bring your bike thanks Bruce

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:41,810
that was awesome um two questions 1 2 or

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:46,080
3 and 20 s / BYOD / no problem okay so

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:48,060
we're a BYOD school we I've worked into

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,770
the price school we weren't and we just

00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,990
push things out on every machine that we

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,000
had at the time we went with Python 24

00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,690
pygame support but since then Python

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,420
please it's no longer an issue because

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,490
we're BYOD I'm not too restrictive with

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,650
Python versions also when students are

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,330
working on different projects they are

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,710
will need like modules that are only

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,680
written for Python 2 and things like

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,060
that so the fact that fundamentally for

00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,970
most the work they do there's a very

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,050
little difference we sort of point out

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,460
the fact that the print statements

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,200
different and the input statement works

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,420
bit different and thats basically covers

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,000
most of it for for the introduction so

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,440
they learn Python 3 but often the switch

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
to Python 2 is necessary for some

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,280
projects and the fact that there's no

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,900
significant complication with

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,310
installation means it's ideal for both

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,140
BYOD and a lab environment yeah who

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:40,530
raised the mic oh yeah so just in terms

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:44,760
of the curriculum from what I saw a lot

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:46,740
of it builds on the sorts of conceptual

00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,710
curriculum that you might have in say

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,280
mathematics so could you comment briefly

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,490
on what overlap there is with

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,740
mathematics and how you deal with a

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,180
teacher to teach level sure so I think

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,430
they were going to give you a couple of

00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,020
talks later on in fact about Python and

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,250
math so I'm going to leave aspects of

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,990
that to those because I don't want to

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,550
take anything away but one of the

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,950
advantages of the digital technologies

00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,900
curriculum being written last is that it

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,240
was able to be written on the basis of a

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,520
sequence mathematics curriculum so

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,550
you'll often see that there are concepts

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,470
being explored in mathematics that fit

00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,880
very very nicely into where you are

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,900
sequentially through the digital

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,220
technologies curriculum ideally I think

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,110
the concept of teaching in a subject

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,390
area needs to be thrown away completely

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,770
right we don't learn in individual

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,120
subjects we never have and we

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,580
will and we don't work in that space

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,200
either so I think what we need to be

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,360
doing is talking on to our maths teacher

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,310
colleagues and we do this a lot at the

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,660
college we have students as an example

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,670
doing a lot of probability and

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,560
statistics when they're in year 11 doing

00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,840
their methods course and we use that

00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,120
when we start introducing things such as

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,650
I'm artificial intelligence so we'll

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,880
actually have a look at things like the

00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,070
monte carlo method and how the

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,450
probability plays into that and what

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,550
we've actually found is that students

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,810
who do our projects have a much better

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,270
understanding than the students who have

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,380
done it only in mathematics and often

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,760
that's because they've been given an

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,390
environment in which it actually has

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,210
meaning see oh yeah thanks for that talk

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,530
so very enlightening my question

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,410
revolves around your first point

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,750
regarding fundamentals so by

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,930
fundamentals do you mean fundamentals of

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,640
the latter of the actual language orders

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,020
of the fundamentals change depending on

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,560
the project so for example you just

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,780
mention Markov chains so do introduce

00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,840
different skill set for that for them to

00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,860
be able to handle yes so I on the focus

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,060
here was specifically on the

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,530
fundamentals of the language so that

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,690
when you're using the language later on

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,090
you understand when it comes time for

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,250
students to do their projects and one of

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,810
the things I'll sort of discuss on my

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,760
Sunday presentation is a little bit

00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,870
about where that fits inside the

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,760
curriculum in terms of these these

00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,470
concepts are talking about but what we

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,920
do is we give students the opportunity

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,450
to identify the concepts that are going

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,190
to be most relevant to their interest

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,110
area so when she came to us and said I

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,520
want to do text prediction one of the

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,170
tools that we identified at that point

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,520
was Markov chains we directed her to the

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,870
appropriate information so that she

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,880
could go and find out about it herself

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,620
we actually paired her up with some

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,210
practicing software engineer at

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,710
atlassian who was able to help her and

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,590
talk to her about that as well to give

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,360
her that additional support and on that

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,620
basis she was able to take that

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,500
understanding and her knowledge of

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,060
Python and and build what was a pretty

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,350
cool application I should emphasize all

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,950
of those projects were done in three

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,330
weeks so it's not like we give them

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,210
months and months to work on these

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,310
things either right so so when it comes

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,430
to that it's impossible to teach

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,560
everything to everyone right so what

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,570
I've done over the last few years is

00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,580
identify appropriate resources fam for

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,930
sizing those fundamentals and then I do

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:54,420
students to what is appropriate for

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:56,250
their particular project I'll offer the

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,600
language fundamentals are really it's

00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,580
just the underlying like control

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,050
structures understanding how when you

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,340
saw something in a variable it's

00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,870
actually dealt with throughout the

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,060
program the concept of scope is

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,800
important when you're introducing oh oh

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,900
what an object is how it's a

00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,910
representation of data and and and all

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,690
of those kinds of things it's just

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,150
emphasizing that you're not just

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,130
learning a statement understanding what

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,420
that statement is doing so that you

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,770
understand how that data is being

00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,810
manipulated and moved around in the

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:26,820
greater program that kind of stuff yeah

00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:29,850
and this will be our last question um I

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,520
love your focus on real problems I'm

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,870
just curious to know you said you had I

00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,270
think electives prior to your 11 and 12

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:41,580
only we don't but our our the schools do

00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:44,520
yet okay so you just have kids coming

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,260
into your 12 what kind of skill

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,590
differential do you have its massive

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,930
it's huge right so as I said cat came in

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,220
in second half of your 11 with no

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,070
knowledge and damen have been

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,260
programming since you rate what we do is

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,540
for the students who have that

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,190
background knowledge it's still in their

00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,390
interest to do the intro unit right

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,770
because they're going to get a massively

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,930
high score which is going to help with

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,580
their eight are but what we do is we

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,890
ensure that as they're working through

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,960
the problems we won't just introduce the

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,910
while structure and let them sort of

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,960
work through it and understand what's

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,040
going on because I already know that

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,170
right they just need to know the new

00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,760
syntax so what we'll do is we'll

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,740
actually give them interesting

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,080
challenges and ask them to only solve it

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,580
with that type of solution right and

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,380
that's where we can actually start

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,720
introducing the idea of things like

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,160
recursion pretty early on with those

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,570
kids rather than leaving it to the

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,470
normal spot in the sequence so that's

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:40,600
how we address that thank you very much

00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,660
Bruce and

00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,660
