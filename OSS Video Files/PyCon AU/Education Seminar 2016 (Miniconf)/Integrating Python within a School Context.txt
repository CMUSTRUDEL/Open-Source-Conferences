Python is an ideal first programming language for secondary school students due to the simplicity of its syntax, its enforced code formatting, and the extensibility of the language. Introducing Python to a school however, takes planning, an incremental approach, and modification to existing curriculum plans based on experience. In this presentation, you will be given an overview of how a high school has introduced Python through years 8-12. You will also learn about various Python packages and environments that can be of benefit to a school including: Python Turtle, Grok Learning, Pygame, Flask, and PythonAnywhere.

okay I really happy to introduce Brad

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,069
Nielsen brad has spent the last five

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,120
years teaching IT at Marist College in

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,440
Queensland he was not always a teacher

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,170
he has a degree in multiple year in IT

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
and previously worked in IT for five

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,199
years as a consultant and a web

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,900
developer specializing in online

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:27,990
learning and learning management system

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:35,190
software so Thank You Brad thank you Dad

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:37,350
hi everyone okay so what I want to talk

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,469
about today is just how gone about

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,960
integrating Python within miles college

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:48,210
miles college is an all-boys school in

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,030
Queensland it has 1600 students and when

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,489
I got to the college there wasn't any

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,090
programming being taught certainly not

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,059
text based programming anyway so as I'm

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,469
the only IT teacher at the college I was

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,489
given the task of revamping the

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,170
curriculum and this is very much

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,540
starting with a clean slate which was

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,110
good and bad because it was a challenge

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:18,810
and it also meant that I could do things

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:22,650
my way so I had to choose a programming

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,650
language and i settled on Python for the

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,259
following reasons one the scores of

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,850
bring-your-own-device school so I wanted

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,759
a programming language that would work

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,250
on different devices and pythons

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,150
interpreted so me it seemed like a good

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,240
fit it lacks the complexity of Java and

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,920
C sharp so students can worry about

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,200
programming rather than having to worry

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,630
about keywords and method declarations

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,750
code formatting is strict so the fact

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,570
that life and requires indenting i think

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,090
is a great thing because if kids don't

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,450
learn to format their code it's a habit

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,280
that will haunt them i think for the

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,789
rest of that their coding lives so

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,679
having strict formatting improves the

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,300
readability of their code and also i

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,090
think helps them understand the code as

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,100
well

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,780
also because it's open source I thought

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,069
those many libraries and packages

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,970
available and I was also encouraged by

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,030
the fact that was a lot of tutorials

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,810
software that I could lean on a little

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,670
bit knowing that I was teaching parking

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,060
from scratch and that all the different

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,980
grades hadn't done in Python it was

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,590
going to be a massive task if I was to

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,350
do too much direct teaching so tutorial

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,030
software could help in that regard and

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,310
finally I also knew that a lot of

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,310
universities were starting to use Python

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,050
as a first-year language and so anyway I

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,239
could give my students to step up when

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,920
they go to university seemed like a good

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,190
thing there was difficulties to

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,200
implementation firstly the lack of prior

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,750
knowledge so starting from scratch in

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,269
the school I couldn't expect too much of

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,040
my Year Elevens in year 12 students in

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,890
terms of what they could produce unless

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,090
they had some kind of background to draw

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,910
upon so I really needed to actually look

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,269
at introducing it introducing Python

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,640
slowly within the school and developing

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,910
that prior knowledge before going on

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,190
with the big projects sourcing software

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,680
and devices was difficult not because

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,260
there isn't a lot out there it was just

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,870
because you learn these things with

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,910
experience and once you've tried a

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,380
particular piece of software with

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,680
students then you know whether it's any

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,450
good or bad so it was it was difficult

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,910
without it that experience it was

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,360
something that I had to develop over

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,920
time also the lack of IT teachers having

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,079
more than one IT teacher would have been

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,070
beneficial as in I could bounce ideas

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,930
off someone else and being the only I

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,900
teacher in the school where there is a

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,030
cohort where we're expecting to teach

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,220
some kind of digital technologies

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,109
curriculum across the whole cohort then

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm really having to rely upon other

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:16,970
teachers who haven't really been taught

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,019
same type of skills in terms of coding

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,289
and then finally lack of time allocation

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,510
so and this is an issue for most schools

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:30,030
certainly because I t had died down

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,030
a lot within miles college there wasn't

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,680
much interest among students the current

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,990
curriculum that although the curriculum

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,300
they had been taught very much was Word

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,550
Excel spreadsheets that kind of stuff it

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,180
was very dry and students weren't

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,060
attracted to the subject so there had to

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,730
be a I mean as I am drawing interest

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,860
into the subject now but it's really

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,010
then having to fight for time allocation

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,500
and one thing about teaching in a large

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,080
school teachers are very protective of

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,200
their particular subject areas so if you

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,390
take a term of IT away from away from

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,750
another teacher then you do hear

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,090
complaints so the lack of time

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,010
allocation towards IT was it was another

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,850
issue that I had to deal with especially

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:22,320
if I wanted to build some type of our

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:25,650
progressive approach to programming so

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,960
the solutions i found and i'm still this

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,640
is my fourth year in terms of developing

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,570
that that curriculum within the school

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,220
or four and a half years now and what I

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,500
found it is taking incremental approach

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,780
so not expecting things to happen too

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,810
quickly but at the same time knowing

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,440
where you want to go and i found that

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:50,220
now that i've got your 11 12 students

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,320
who've who've learned stuff prior to

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,210
your 11 12 in years eight and nine or

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,010
sudden finding their abilities in terms

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,580
of programming and getting better and

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,660
better so much so i'm saying to be

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,450
increasingly amazed but what they can

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,150
produce now but i couldn't always do

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,470
that so for my Year 11s and 12s I mean

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,110
he's starting to see the fruits of my

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,790
labor now but in previous grades I

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,550
couldn't expect too much of them because

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,360
they hadn't had that type of experience

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,360
collaborating with other school so

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,910
things like this here and also being on

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,110
cue site which is a Queensland type of

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,270
discussion list around introducing ITT's

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,480
in schools has been very beneficial

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,550
because I can see what other schools are

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,670
doing and then take those ideas and

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,110
implement them with my students and

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,950
certainly have done that just listening

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,380
to some of the press

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,890
patients today will guide me in the

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,290
future as well finding online tutorial

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,380
software I I'm going to talk about crop

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:55,430
learning later but I like I said before

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,040
I actually it's been a great help to me

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,780
not because I just want the tutorial

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,920
software to teach all the students but

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,290
because it's allowed me to do a bit of

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,160
direct instruction with my kids and also

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,810
sit back and be more of sylhet at a role

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,330
so I can allow students to go through

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,220
the software and I can help them when

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,630
they have issues or I can extend them as

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,180
they going forward rather than

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,400
constantly having to keep the class on

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,210
one level and waiting for the stragglers

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,260
in my class I can push on my head

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,170
pushing for time allocation to the

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,940
subject i'm happy to say now that the

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,850
digital technologies curriculum has been

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,740
released the school is really pushing

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:43,650
into creating more time for the years 9

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,010
and 10 to get more experience with with

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,510
the IT curriculum so as of next year

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,210
we're looking at having a whole semester

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,090
subject for your nines across the whole

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,150
cohort and that's never happened before

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,520
so that's starting to happen now and

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,530
that poses challenges in itself to in

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,060
terms of resourcing because then you got

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,430
to start thinking about what kind of

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,830
resources you can use for a whole cohort

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:12,750
of students rather than just a class of

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,310
20 to 30 students and finally I one of

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,150
the things I found really beneficial to

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,130
myself is the use of clubs because i

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,490
have a have two clubs in a year i have a

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,770
3d games club in first term and then i

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,800
use robotics and electronics club in

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,470
third term and those two clubs allow me

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,280
to kind of test software and devices on

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,320
students and their much well they're

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,580
much more quick cleverer than me in some

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,770
ways they've got more time to spend

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,210
their more interesting engaged off I've

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,700
got to think about too many other things

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,380
so allowing these kids to explore the

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,830
devices shows me what can be done with

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,510
them rather than me just pushing what I

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,330
know on to the students I'm allowing

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,630
them to research for me so in a way I'm

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,300
kind of

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,210
using my clubs as a a set of guinea pigs

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,980
you could say but it's really working I

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:09,140
think okay so I want to explore the the

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,930
programming sequence at maras now and

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,480
with context as in that even though this

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,890
is very much piping related i am going

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,040
to also discuss some concepts and other

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,920
types of areas that feed into later

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,500
platen projects and I think if I didn't

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,900
actually provide that context you'd be

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,030
getting a bit of it doesn't give a clear

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,360
view there are certain precursors that

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,370
are required before I get to the larger

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:44,460
platen projects that my Year Elevens and

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:47,850
twelves do so as of this year of started

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:52,170
introducing programming in two years

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,960
five and six am arse we have a group of

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,750
say eighty eighty year five students and

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,570
18-year sections and then our big large

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,220
intake is a year seven so for them I'm

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,770
very much interested in doing visual

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,660
block coding so they understand the

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,720
fundamentals of coding and also i'm

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,490
trying to make coding really fun so i

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,740
don't want them just there any

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,450
experience with IT is doing spreadsheets

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,260
and word and stuff i really want them to

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,790
get involved get interested and provide

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,540
that opportunity there for the kids to

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,490
actually then explore what they can do

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,070
outside of the classroom perhaps as a

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,130
library activity or something like that

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,970
so I very much gone into the robots for

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,740
them I'll purchased ozo BOTS the fives

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,650
other BOTS these small miniature robots

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,130
that can actually they pretty much a

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,780
coded black color you can even hold them

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,220
up to web browser and use something

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,500
called ozo blockley which is like

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,350
scratch and it will flash all the colors

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,230
in then program the robots to go around

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,490
so it's good because it teaches students

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,290
some of the fundamentals of programming

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,270
and it's a very visual and interactive

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,130
way for students to learn things like

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,230
deconstructing a program or constructing

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:11,110
a program and extending it so for the

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,690
five sets works really well year 6 i'm

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,570
starting to bring this in for next year

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,930
so i've purchased some drones being the

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:24,160
Sphero the mini parrot and the ollie and

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,140
I've also been playing around with

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,170
Tinker which is again like a scratch

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,140
program for the drones the only issue

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,410
there is Tinker only works on our

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,320
tablets unfortunately so I'd prefer them

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,530
to actually be using other a web browser

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,900
or or using it just a normal PC rather

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,580
than having to rely on tablets we do

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,520
have a set of tablets in the primary so

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,710
it's it's not a big issue but very much

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,810
I'm conscious of the fact i'm trying to

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,610
make it so with the school being a

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,470
bring-your-own-device school i'm trying

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,990
to make sure that the programming

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:04,060
applications they use a device friendly

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,820
okay so then we go to year 7 and this is

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,340
where we're staying to transition from

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,070
visual block coding to text based coding

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,560
now year 7 is our big intake so in the

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,690
year 7 we get 240 students coming to the

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,750
school so every grade has about 240

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,270
students except for year five and six

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,610
and so we start teaching them using

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,180
stretch we don't know where those

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,890
students have come from so we don't know

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,560
what a mount of programming they've

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,710
previously learnt so we are starting

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,750
from from basics again but I think

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,850
scratch is a good way to do it one

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,570
indicator for the whole cohort because

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,730
it's 240 students too it's free and it's

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,960
in a browser so it's very easy for them

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,770
to program and also we also are

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,420
integrating that into an art and music

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,690
subject so what they do is the students

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,610
create both music like game music and

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,050
they create artwork for their game and

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,840
then scratch they bring it all together

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:12,160
and program their game and all students

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:15,580
in year 7 do that we finish off using

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,950
something called code combat code combat

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,900
is really really good in fact I know my

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,470
brother's using code combat to our

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:27,029
teachers seven-year-old son

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,799
python programming code combats like a

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:32,019
it's it's a gaming interface so it's

00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,449
like the gamma fication of Python

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,579
programming tutorials so students go

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:39,730
around these mazes and they have to type

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:41,470
Python code to solve the maze as they

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,540
get gem so they get experience points

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,670
and they can purchase items and then

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,499
then then as they purchase items they

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,319
get things like a sword and then the

00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:51,970
sword allows them to use other functions

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:55,179
and they can use the sword to attack

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,629
enemies it's it really is a fun game and

00:13:55,179 --> 00:14:02,079
students really really love it the only

00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,999
problem I find is that with and I use

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,029
this in year eight as well both in year

00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:09,309
7 year 8 in terms of the time allocation

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,980
I've really only got three or four

00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,899
subjects three or four lessons each year

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,809
in which the students can use code

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:19,449
combat where it's actually using class

00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:23,290
time and that's quite a big limitation

00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:25,449
really so it's something that can really

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,089
get into I still find that within those

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,189
three or four lessons in that year the

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,339
students can only finish a module so the

00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:35,649
idea is in year 7 and this is their

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,509
first taste of Python 2 so the idea is

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:41,470
in Year seven they finish the first

00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:43,540
module and then in year eight as part of

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,999
the text subjects they do they finish

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,529
the second module and then if they

00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,419
finish both modules then I'll let them

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,910
play minecraft which is a pretty good

00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:56,439
incentive for the kids okay so year nine

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,869
ten now this is something that will

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:01,899
change next year at the moment we have

00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:04,149
elective subjects so it's semester now

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:08,949
we have semester units and the students

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:10,569
can elect to do the IT subject that we

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,519
have going so there's there's two

00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:15,160
subjects across you nine and ten and

00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,629
they can alternate based on their

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,119
timetable they can alternate when they

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,579
do both those two subjects if they wish

00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,949
to so it's an elective subject so

00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:27,279
normally i would say in terms of student

00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:30,220
cohort i'm getting about 40 or 50

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,559
students out of that cohort elect to do

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,319
the subject next year that will change

00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,590
so next year all your lines will have to

00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,080
do

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,180
semester subjects in IT which is going

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,910
to pose a whole lot of problems or

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,670
challenges to me in terms of structure

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:49,360
in their curriculum now I'm a big fan of

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,740
grok learning and that surprises me

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,050
because I'm always on the lookout for

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,840
free software and groc learning exit

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,210
costs me money but I think it's worth it

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,560
because I've tried I've tried using

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:08,350
things like carnac add in the end and so

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,570
it can academy and code Academy so both

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,630
of them I think take the kids through

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:17,560
the programming process too quickly so

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,450
it's actually um it's not good as in

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,490
that the kids don't get regular

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,440
programming exercise they really need

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,000
practices at a basic level before they

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,950
move on so it really needs to be kept

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,620
reasonably simple and have a nice

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,090
progression to it rather than throw them

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,470
the deep end and then I'll suddenly get

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,150
stroke they struggle on they get

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,820
frustrated and they get turned off

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:45,340
programming so I think rock learning is

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,080
good in that in that way you can even

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,000
see I like the fact you can keep track

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,370
of a student's progress too so keep

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,320
students accountable so you can see in

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,060
that top right corner there I've got

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,220
students and I can actually look at how

00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,860
many problems they've solved what

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,330
problems having trouble with so for me

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,230
it's a great way to keep track of my

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:08,740
students the only criticism I would have

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,140
of grok learning is that I think it

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,930
actually takes too long to introduce the

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,790
idea of function the students so you'll

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,790
actually find functions is actually in

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,590
the second programming unit whereas if

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,540
you if you've used python a lot

00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,459
functions are used all the time even

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,890
from the start as soon as someone types

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:29,530
a print command and then these round

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,840
brackets and they put in a string

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,550
they're using a function so for me I

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,130
actually think function should be taught

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,110
a bit earlier and so what I do is I

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,810
normally mix-up Rock learning with a few

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,750
lessons of direct instruction where I

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,960
will actually go through and teach those

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,670
types of concepts and the other thing

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,299
along with that functions idea is the

00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,730
idea of India

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:53,289
in code I think that's probably the one

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,360
of those difficult concepts for students

00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:58,269
is that when you indent code in Python

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,279
you're actually creating our continuous

00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,960
block of code and then once you break

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,809
the indent all of a sudden it's not

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,249
running that block anymore so it's

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:08,529
something I like to emphasize at the

00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:10,600
start otherwise I think drop learning is

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:13,360
great and I use grok learning from a

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:21,549
year nines and tens and also into year

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:23,289
11 so going to year 11 12 I see sorry i

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:25,539
just want to before we go into your 11

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,220
and 12 i just want to also show you I've

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,169
highlighted in yellow some of the other

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,700
concepts that they're learning this

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,519
isn't all that I teach them in terms

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,049
that I take curriculum but it's

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:40,690
important because these concepts or

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:45,100
applications are actually used within my

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:47,799
year 11 12 course so I actually teach

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,190
them a bit of web development in year 9

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,679
I also teach them object-oriented

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,200
programming the principles of it using

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,519
the application game maker and I see

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,759
think game makers a really good

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,350
application for this because it actually

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:04,389
teaches them that objects have

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,389
properties and functions it teaches them

00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:10,659
how you can create instances of objects

00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:13,779
it also shows you shows the student how

00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:15,279
a basic game would work so the

00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,379
fundamentals of a game being that you

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,169
have a game loop and then the game loop

00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:22,720
runs the logic of each object and then

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:24,330
it renders every object to screen so

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,320
game make is really good for this

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,559
whereas I don't think it's necessarily

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,249
that good for teaching students text

00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:35,139
based programming you can use the

00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:38,350
language gml to do text based

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:41,259
programming but I feel like it's a bit

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,139
of a hurdle for the students they're not

00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,960
up to that point where they can do much

00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,659
to it whereas it's great for teaching

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,090
object-oriented programming even using

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:55,539
the icon the iconic type of programming

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,730
interface that game making users finally

00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,279
we we finish off United 10 with a bit of

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,429
app inventor and also a bit of microsoft

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,919
access and we introduce a

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:10,169
QR which will come in handy when we get

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:12,240
to your 11 year 12 so you're 11 year 12

00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:16,590
the students are expected in major

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,259
projects so in a major project takes the

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,720
whole term for the students to complete

00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:26,340
with year eleven I get the students

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,570
developing games using pie down and this

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,629
is like I said there's an incremental

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,249
process so I did give them the option to

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,749
still use game maker if they wish

00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,369
because I consider game maker a bit

00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:38,039
easier and the students consider it a

00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:42,330
bit easier but they're encouraged

00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:44,249
strongly to go the pie game way and I

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,710
also tell them well if you want to get

00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:50,249
an A if your project you're better off

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,840
using pi game so I make it very clear to

00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,580
them that I would prefer that they

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,369
challenged themselves using pi game

00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:00,330
rather than settling for something a bit

00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:02,669
easier in terms of game makeup year 12s

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,809
their major project is an online

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:10,559
database driven website using the Python

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:14,789
package flask and I found flask is very

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,149
effective in teaching kids how to how

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:20,340
web server works and you'll notice that

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:22,559
i've also i've also got there that

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,289
interacts with sqlite so as i was saying

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,019
the year 9 10 subjects actually lend

00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,399
itself to the year 11 and 12 subjects as

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:31,860
in there certain skills they have to

00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:33,330
know the year 12 project really is a

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,940
culmination of everything they've

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,009
learned through school so they learnt

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,600
programming they've learned database

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:44,580
design they've learnt SQL they've learnt

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,100
the web development in their combining

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,899
all together in one final project so

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,700
it's a nice way I think to consolidate

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,649
their knowledge and also encourage

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,799
themselves to stretch stretch themselves

00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:58,860
and create something quite complex

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:02,249
pygame i think is a great way to teach

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,399
object-oriented program because students

00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:07,080
have to actually code from scratch the

00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:09,840
objects that they're going to make and

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,960
so they're very much learning the

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,279
object-oriented principles that they

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,389
they did in game maker but they're

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:31,409
actually our practice

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:33,749
in terms of coding structures okay might

00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:44,639
just show you a game that one of my

00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:45,599
students is made I've got this is where

00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,399
I'm starting to see the fruits of my

00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,119
labor because I've got three students in

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:54,209
year 11 who they're there pygame

00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:56,129
application is just amazing and there's

00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:58,739
like this friendly rivalry between the

00:22:56,129 --> 00:23:00,869
three students as well so most students

00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:03,029
actually chose to do pygame not all them

00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:04,829
did but most of them did and so that's

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,769
I'm starting to see that progression of

00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:11,459
programming skills and in terms of of

00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:13,169
the programming I mean to be honest this

00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:18,029
is almost university level programming

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:21,229
on I can't I can't mention just how

00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,229
impressed I am by up

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:42,880
I know if you can hear the music but

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,910
this song he's got a little snowman that

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,570
goes around see they collect all the all

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:53,980
the blocks the monsters can eat the

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:56,050
blocks and I can actually make blocks as

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,620
well and probably that's what I'm most

00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,120
impressed about is that this student has

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,440
got this multi-dimensional array of

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:13,960
blocks that he can also add to in terms

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:15,730
of his program yeah anyway this is

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,900
something like if you use game maker you

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,960
could make something like that very

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,660
easily but using pygame that is a

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,480
massive achievement it's it takes

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,540
significant programming to do and he's

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,170
learned all those concepts to do with

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,970
object-oriented coding to do so and he

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,620
wasn't the only one like I said I got

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,200
three students in that class we've got a

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,580
a plus for their project and that's

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,610
because they've learnt Python from a

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:51,220
young age and they're starting to now

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:59,590
practice it i also want to show you

00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:02,760
flask you would have heard ok you would

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:05,950
have heard of django for example and

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,350
Django is good isn't it so it's a Python

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,800
web server do anything I'd say that

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,070
Django is it's very abstract the

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:20,860
students don't really interact with the

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:22,990
SQL code that they do with with flask so

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,120
flask is a web server that they can

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,050
create and it allows them to interact

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,600
with SQL and also allows them to create

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,160
a series of request handlers so I've

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,700
actually got three students in year 12

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:40,180
50 themselves multiplayer games using

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,170
flask although this one obviously isn't

00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,170
working at the moment

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,779
it's hard to demonstrate anyway this

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,510
this student in particular has actually

00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:54,590
created both an autumn crosses grid and

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:57,799
a chat room so he's actually really gone

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,450
a far and above what he had to do it was

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,850
a project where they just had to create

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,860
online database they could do whatever

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,539
they want with it the minimum was they

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,919
had to actually be able to register a

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:13,640
user add to be able to login and he's

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,950
gone ahead and used both Python Ajax

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,279
JavaScript you name it to create this

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,370
online application before it just to

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,769
conclude cuz i'm not running out of time

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:28,580
he's also created this using and this is

00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:31,370
the flask programming year he's created

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,399
it using a cloud computing platform

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,750
called Python anywhere and python

00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,760
anywhere basically allows you to create

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,919
your own web application of flask sets

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,320
up all the files for you so there's no

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,570
configuration issues the students are

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,299
programmed within the browser which

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,970
takes all the right boxes for me I try

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,880
to avoid projects for students have two

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,399
are doing massive configuration issues

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,350
ok so I'll wrap it up there because I

00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:07,610
think I'm out of time Oh does anyone

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:16,909
have any questions let's think bread so

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:19,039
do we have any questions yes do you find

00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,769
that they work well individually or of

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,909
you you're teaming people up and doing

00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,950
pair program and things like that and

00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:30,350
what's worked well for you there I i

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,760
actually have minor projects like an

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,190
online i like just a normal database

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,500
where I let them work in pairs i also

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,179
have a robotics project they do they're

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,309
doing this term in year 12 where they

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:42,139
get to work in pairs but they're the

00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,090
minor projects the major projects i've

00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:47,600
actually told them they have to work by

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,919
themselves just because i think students

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,860
hide themselves when they're in groups

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,409
and the other thing is and i was having

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,320
this discussion before with tim over

00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:58,510
there we at our school we don't do a lot

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,370
of great project

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,410
and I think it's actually an issue that

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,170
the students get to get 12 and they

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,330
don't know how to work in groups so I'd

00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,480
love to do some more group projects but

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:14,480
it's difficult when students I haven't

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,800
done a lot of group projects and they do

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,950
tender there's always one or two

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,660
students that hide the other thing and

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,090
this came to me before when I was

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,960
watching brisas presentation is the idea

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,820
of ill-defined projects I've struggled

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,520
with like I'd love to put more

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,450
ill-defined projects in my in my classes

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,240
the problem however is that some of my

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,820
students if you give them at all to find

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,560
task there they always have a thought

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,320
bubble like sometimes you get these this

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,640
Ginsu just concept or bubbles like every

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,690
day it's a different projects a

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,810
different idea and they never actually

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,970
get started on the project so what I've

00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,250
tried to do is with my projects I

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:58,550
structure it in such a way that it is

00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,810
individual for the major ones but I also

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,450
tell them this is the minimum

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,980
requirement you've got to get to here so

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,020
there's no ill-defined problem there no

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,960
they have to get to that point after

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,910
that then i say i can now to get above a

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,620
see you've got to come up with something

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,010
and so that's where the ill defined

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,990
project comes into it but arm yes

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:23,060
structuring the assessment is definitely

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:24,700
a challenge um I think that's all the

00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,660
questions unless anyone has one more

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,660
