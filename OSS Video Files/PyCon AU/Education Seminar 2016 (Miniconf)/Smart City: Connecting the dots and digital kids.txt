Schools face a daunting challenge to increase their student
exposure to coding, hands-on technology learning to solve some
real-world problems and teaching STEM principles (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) through design, construction and testing.
This personal presentation by a leading teacher illustrate journey to
connect his students to some real-world problems and the challenges
faced along the way. Following on from an earlier
computational-thinking challenge to build and program a moving
vehicle, Roland's current mission is to challenge students to design,
build a smart city consisting of intelligent vehicles and
infrastructure. To do this they need to program a navigation algorithm
to autonomously navigate vehicles through a series of traffic
challenges that test collision avoidance and road safety. They have
been invited to showcase their work at the ITS2016 Word Congress in
Melbourne with a maker-space for delegates to share our hands-on
problem solving and learning with the software and models developed by
the students. Moonshots live in a grey area between audacious
technology and pure science fiction. Our moonshot was to empower
students around the globe to build and control their future.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
I wasn't always a science teacher or

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,130
technology teacher I actually started

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,820
the industry working for a company known

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,639
as I see I Australia now I Rica my first

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,180
training was in biochemistry and having

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,609
to use the large automatic analyzers big

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,650
machines like the pdp-11 required due to

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,660
have a knowledge of itm programming

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,970
moving into the high school sector from

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,060
after the rural recession in the mining

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,450
recession mining yeah I was a biochemist

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,770
who ended up and expose his division and

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,309
there is a connection to do with the

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,210
dissolution of cattle bonuses and

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,450
explosive pearl in the bottom of mine

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,610
shaft I'd like to share with you a very

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,660
personal journey I have a large number

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,070
of slides and I'm going to rattle

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,420
through quite quickly so I'm sorry you

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,010
won't have much time to tweet or share

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,719
but hang in there because there's a

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,960
keynote I'm going to probably rock your

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,590
socks of what the serendipity of

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,270
opportunity and where I came from in

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,590
1997 well actually 1993 I was the first

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,789
teacher to get a high school connected

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,640
internet but I want to jump forward a

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,470
few years about the time when you had

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,140
the Sojourner Rover that was rolling

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,119
around Mars it was an exciting time for

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,010
being able to connect of Technology and

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,750
this was an animated gif and we're all

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,009
excited about how we can string pictures

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,020
together and movies and begin to share

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,939
them I was one of the first teacher

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,520
labeled is using the web and being able

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,780
to collect resources this was the school

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,009
that I was located at actually now

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,390
that's the roof of the school I was

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,450
located at and we were blessed with

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,009
heavy industry and decline this was an

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,530
asbestos factory was optus at the school

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,060
and we would watch it from the north and

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,670
the dust that would blow over the school

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,290
this was animated camera system that

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,729
would place on the roof of the school I

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,890
was in charge everything there started

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,759
with F first-year teachers flags

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,799
photocopiers in first aid and this was

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,860
the looking south where there were more

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,950
trees we were interested in being able

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,899
to collect whether we were making

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,020
connections I've been involved with a

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,909
project by Al Gore called the globe

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,560
project of connecting students around

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,640
the world with this rudimentary internet

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,009
that God invented and I was came to use

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,170
a net meeting this is a Japanese sister

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,959
school they're excited

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,250
could talk to Australia and we'd wave at

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,500
each other across the internet and it

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,209
was really quite exciting for us I guess

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,920
I was looking for a way to be able to

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,880
collaborate and do the stuff for the

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,670
globe mission we were collecting

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,010
research data crunching the data through

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,480
doing some rudimentary analysis with it

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,890
and for the students it was a chance to

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,160
go outside and sit inside the chicken

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,239
wire cage we had to do this because

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,800
students would come in and vandalize it

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,709
and at least this way we could protect

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,019
the weather instruments on top of the

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,030
school I place the weather station this

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,530
is air caretaker Alex and his great

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,760
great grand ancestors had built your

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,950
crop less and he thought it was a

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,130
notable tribute that he could also build

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,680
my weather station here there's Alex we

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,269
collected the data I wanted to put a

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,590
camera up there and actually start to

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,970
collect things this was our camera we

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,880
only had one camera in the whole school

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,330
and we made a lot of use of it I got

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,239
invited by mistake to a conference at

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,440
the science works which is a lot little

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,959
place on the other side of the bridge in

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,160
Melbourne I didn't know what so we had

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,390
to quickly think of an experiment

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,060
because we didn't actually have anything

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,190
to present so I grabbed the photocopier

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,690
made paper scientific instruments that's

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,150
as much as our school budget could

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,459
afford as you can imagine we went there

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,380
we had a wonderful presentation this is

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,660
the science minister who came in and had

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,910
a look at our presentation of paper

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,170
balances and scales mind you we were

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,280
nestled amongst all these private

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,299
schools who had their plastic

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,769
dissections and computer equipment and

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:47,570
anyway Barry Jones was impressed so I

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:51,650
was very happy about that our school is

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:55,400
a unique juncture in the universe it's

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:58,700
aligned perfectly along the axis of east

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,180
and west which means that one time of

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,500
the year the solstice the sun stretches

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,850
down the corridor I used to terrify the

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,109
cleaning staff by laying on the ground

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,810
and taking photograph at that particular

00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,910
event there and they'd stare with horror

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,500
the Sun right as it ended was like that

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,299
the science covered at the very end some

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,579
demonic beasts would come strolling out

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:22,130
as it was in 1769 and there's other chap

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,360
who went sailing off in his fleet to the

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,889
other side of the world

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,770
and try to do the same thing with the

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:31,430
transect of mercury you see we were

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,289
peated this in 2003 the chapter names

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,879
but I'm captain cook I'll do it a name

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:39,830
dropping here and we had a class I set

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,659
the camera up there's our same camera we

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,259
had good as you seen 10 years we're

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:47,479
still using this one camera and we put

00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,030
this up and we broadcasted on the

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,310
school's web server I was excited we had

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,289
a transect of mercury I had an extra

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,930
class we made a penal whole camera out

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,759
of the room and we followed them around

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,990
me pushing on the floor the kids were

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,520
wrapped they could get out of doing the

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,469
math sector which is boring anyway and

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,879
we were doing this wonderful stuff you

00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,099
can see the ether League crawling across

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,439
the room there with the laptop and here

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,120
we are with the students were pointed

00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,159
out that's mercury and now as you're

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
stunned about it and there we are

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,360
another scene this was just

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
revolutionary stuff here and there are

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,389
the students here and they began to

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,159
share some of their stories because some

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,560
of their ancestors at Eton captain cook

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:26,779
when they were in the islands and we

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,370
were just in or at the idea of

00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,150
technology bringing the world together

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,750
and linking us with history so i won't

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,969
forwards to 2004 because we started to

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,159
make out of this space junk that's what

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:42,409
we could afford this was our technology

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,759
program no Tinker trays for us we were

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,289
raiding the rubbish bins were all sorts

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,789
of spare supplies to make the satellites

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,919
here pushing the boundaries of

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:52,009
technology forward in ways we hadn't

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,330
seen before using animation programs at

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,939
least give the simulation of a space

00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,529
background here this was the Hubble

00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,909
Space Telescope and then starting to use

00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,680
some of the open source software and

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,550
that was where we began to realize we

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,259
didn't have to have a lot of this

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,699
high-tech stuff a lot of exciting things

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:14,330
happening that didn't require this

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:16,219
technology I had a phone call principal

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,699
said there's a bloke on to talk to you

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:21,800
he's from NASA you can't nessa

00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,240
and sound early terrifying like it's

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,699
worse than you've missed your science

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,740
extra yeah okay um as it was this guy

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,349
bill called me and he said I need you to

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,000
make something for me I had no idea was

00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,220
Bill Nye the Science Guy

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,750
and I said yes and he said we'll send it

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,890
you've got effects that faxes then still

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,660
only North Korea's got faxes now and

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,600
we're cranking out this huge facts and

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,240
we started to make this thing it was

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,370
terrifying students were working

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,230
furiously this was the year turn boys

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,120
would kind of finish the school program

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,530
you kind of have one park until about

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,530
the end of november but then they go

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,430
feral and there were busy trying to work

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,080
for these cogs i know a lot of

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,090
calculations we had to get spreadsheets

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,600
out do the calculations to construct

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,250
this earth dial so here we are in the

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,140
back of the computer room the big boxes

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,430
there the girls were busy painting you

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,110
can see the linux penguin up the top

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,110
there we were very open source school

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,300
there we go earth dial and what have

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,370
actually happened two worlds one son we

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,620
haven't realized it there's the Bunnings

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,780
crew they donated the would i get their

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,680
photo no idea what they were standing up

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,240
for but and there's me on the roof we've

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,070
got Alex up there I've got to mount this

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,850
thing Alex this is really important it's

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,260
from NASA can't there sir we

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,590
found an old CD i left there 10 years

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,910
earlier and here we are my father and we

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,560
were screwing this thing together in the

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,479
shed we've nicking bits off the

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,860
Christmas tree actually because that's

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,660
one of the dongles there to get this

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,400
thing up and running and we did it in

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,620
two weeks we managed to construct

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,729
ourselves and earth dial and there's my

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,530
little daughter Erica she'll appear a

00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:06,050
bit later I'll just show the time spent

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,360
here so 2006 we had this thing running

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,740
on the roof of the school and we hadn't

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,450
realized a building made a mistake he'd

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,780
forwarded contacted to college sorry

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,120
Monash and but he'd actually contacted a

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,710
high school he'd seen the webcast of our

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,540
mercury tracer for the Iraq and do

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,919
school but he'd forgotten that the ABC

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,030
took pity because we were still at the

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,470
bottom the list actually flipped the

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,440
list around status on the top of the

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,090
list and so we have one in the

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,580
Smithsonian Museum one of the British

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,250
Science Museum one in brazil won in san

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,890
diego utah it is all about actually in

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,080
West all secondary college was made by a

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,849
bunch of year ten students and they

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,480
fought it was absolutely hilarious we'd

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,040
actually pulled it off serbia we've got

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,610
our roof tile here it is actually

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,880
broadcasting here

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,230
and we had a calibration problem until

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,100
we realized that are you stay light

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,810
saving but it was a lot of fun and for

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,920
the high school students or by the oh by

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,720
the way was filled in there was a knot

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,290
in the wood we couldn't get rid of in

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,970
Melbourne there it was exciting NASA

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,050
actually had mucked up a little bit

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,459
because we were the only southern

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,950
hemisphere reference station for this

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,930
project they had been taken into account

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,820
because that was the one of the chance

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,670
on the facts that came through then we

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,980
got another image later the reflection

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,480
of the Sun off the panel and the perspex

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,820
cover actually in defeated with the web

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,339
camera and it took us two days to figure

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,709
out how to get some polarizing filters

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,110
to actually take out the problem and it

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,459
was a real crack-up so they were very

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,329
impressed with the Australian ingenuity

00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,180
being able to solve problems well the

00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:41,579
Planetary Society featured our work we

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,560
had a chance to give some internet

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,350
hangouts and presentations about what

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,430
we're up to what we're doing so there we

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,579
were we were on Mars we were on the back

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,750
of the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers

00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:56,760
because on the backs of these Rovers was

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,839
a sundial and we were the reference

00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,399
station so if you went to the NASA

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,790
website and have a look at Spirit and

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,560
Opportunity whether you were looking

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,250
there was westall real high school in

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,079
Melbourne made by a bunch of kids who

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,130
were waiting to finish off the year 10

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,360
program low Sun high Sun and the kids

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,100
would come back two weeks later and

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:25,140
you'd have the day/night swap over and

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:28,019
it really was another planet well that

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,680
was a wonderful six-month project but

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,930
the rover's didn't stop Deborah vain

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,790
mission director from the cloud set

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,230
environment mission kangana visited the

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,910
school she couldn't believe what had

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,140
actually happened and she came into a

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,899
classroom filled with cardboard

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,519
satellites and all sorts of crazy

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,320
equipment and I was really excited

00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,170
because we had a chance to show up what

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,459
we're doing and we were the real McCoy

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,800
NASA couldn't believe it and invited me

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,079
to JPL to give a talk about the work

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,370
that the kids have been doing and i love

00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,010
that stick on the back of the bike real

00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,800
men who love science these were a really

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,080
crazy

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,940
wonderful bunch of guys and we had a

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,220
chance to talk about the real satellite

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,850
models that they make had a chance to

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,200
look at the sum of the modeling how they

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,820
build them one thing I didn't realize is

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,110
they actually hand make satellite it's

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,850
not like they just pull the bits off the

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,470
shelf they actually cut these out with

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,860
Stanley knives and bits and pieces and

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,839
screw them together that's one of the

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,290
clean rooms where they were assembling I

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,269
think that was the OCO satellite this is

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:35,800
one of the test banks where they do the

00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:37,600
testing for the rover robots I did what

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:43,930
we could do best at our school we

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:46,620
decided to make a dance about it-

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,620
university

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:28,830
Galileo and I called the things try get

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:32,200
through this there we go better so I

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,970
think having one besides trying rewarded

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,500
with a production about the life and

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,510
therefore the universe I could sort of

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,540
rest on my laurels but the kids wouldn't

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:46,120
stop there we were invited to give a

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:50,830
tour I just put Galileo aside for a

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,330
moment so we had a chance to give a tool

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,760
here of the tip in billa tracking

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,790
station that's the chief NASA publicity

00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,700
director there again we kept the system

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,440
going we had the equipment on the roof

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,230
of the school here the rover's wouldn't

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,080
stop running in 2011 I was invited to

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,820
the Curiosity rover launched before I

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,460
ran up there I had to actually quickly

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:17,220
scrub beside the panel this is the

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,450
actual weather station this is me

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,830
accumulated ten years because we'd only

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,880
expected the rover's to run for six

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,470
months and ten years they're still

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,210
running around on Mars this is me

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,630
furiously getting up there scraping the

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,890
bird poop off scraping the rubbish off

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,940
scrubbing away furiously as every

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,200
teacher should do to keep their

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:39,130
scientific instruments in peak condition

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:43,350
here I mean it's just okay that's enough

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,760
about my own private science program so

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,410
where's the coding connection well Bill

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,120
Nye asked me to ramp this up you see

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,920
that's bill and we don't Messer

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,180
so 2012 we had another Venus transept

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,220
but I was getting a bit tired of all of

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,840
these astronomical events they got their

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,960
teachers excited and bringing out the 3d

00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,810
glasses we had a chance to take some of

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,510
my scout groups up to Canberra

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,680
fire lasers at stars there's my daughter

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:15,870
Erica ten years later just hold your

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,390
breath there I was inspired by this

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,700
little beast here it's a ripple what

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,490
they've done with the rover's and I was

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,680
excited about what we can do so I met up

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,810
with Russell Jenkin help me coordinate

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,880
the cloud sat down and said I want to

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,290
try something a bit different my moon

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,839
shot was to actually model of vehicle

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,430
program it to move and coded the thing I

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,600
got a bit tired of science competitions

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,250
where the kids and make the solar car

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,330
and they put pipe cleaners and clearly

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,010
things on them to know would look really

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,900
cool and it run on a track and you think

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,570
wow and convert some art no electricity

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,760
I wanted to think and I thought this was

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,740
my men shot because Kristen voyage is

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,450
something that is a real problem this is

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,279
in Brisbane at one of the conference to

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,690
went to buy obviously one of the buses

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,630
have had trouble recognizing with the

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,040
road starts and finishes it's the real

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,080
world and I thought there's a real

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,600
problem here I took the same group of

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,680
students here to a workshop at Vic roads

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,839
where we had a look at the traffic

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,140
operations room we were interested to

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,420
see here how we can actually model the

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,580
movement of traffic around a city now

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,470
the students were already programming in

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,530
this case it was my year 10 game

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,070
programming class I subverted it and

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,450
told him that this is a game and and

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,820
they could they could see the connection

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,580
it was really cool we were modeling the

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,250
traffic we were having a look at how

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,570
vehicles move how their client I didn't

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,860
realize you see those guys on the

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,630
clipboards and the sides of roads

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,220
they're not counting cars that for the

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,420
loops to what they're actually doing is

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,160
actually looking at the psychology and

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,960
behavior the drivers because when you

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,790
actually build a model like this people

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,900
who drive a noble park where I was

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,220
teaching I very different from the

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,200
people who are driving around the city

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,730
in fact we saw one of the cars doing

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,320
wheelies around the roundabout and they

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,190
picked out my students are there from

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,100
noble park where we were from so we

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,190
began to see the whole system as being

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,839
something very different we impressive

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,400
it quotes because after this wonderful

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,260
presentation and we show some of the

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,180
programs the kids have made using the

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,890
scratch interface for programming this

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,470
is a brainstorm the kids had after the

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,120
session I quickly did on the board is a

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,160
bit of an assessment technique teachers

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,720
like that kind of thing

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,889
you can take a photo and impress the

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,129
principal that you actually did some

00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,290
thinking there and what we ended up

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:27,800
doing here was realizing that this was

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:30,199
really complicated because up to now no

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,339
we were kind of building things just

00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,360
hold it forward because i'm going to

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,339
revisit that in the moment we did a

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
publicity photo here for the principal

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:43,639
here we are we've left ourselves curious

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,439
and hungry here's the model that the

00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,819
kids were making that's a train and you

00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,350
had to quickly jump between the train

00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:51,019
tracks now don't worry about it

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,350
skywriting just fly underneath this is

00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:56,810
the intersection with some different

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,670
vehicles here some of the collision zone

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,829
problems it's really quite complicated

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,470
we wanted to actually make something

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:06,730
from this so we got ourselves some of

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,079
the wires and plugs and kits IT had been

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,159
disassembled the only computers left in

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,199
the school that we can really use were

00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,789
in the art department they managed to

00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,980
hang on them for the music keyboards and

00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:17,600
that was kind of handy because we could

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,760
click these bits together and hide under

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,280
the benches there and then actually do

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,990
some of the circuitry and componentry we

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,370
got a wave it we found a cupboard that

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,870
music weren't using we could hire their

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:31,159
stuff this is my auto car team we

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,640
actually got together we made in the

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:36,169
library a makerspace and we built our

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,690
card this one's 20 bucks worth of a

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:40,669
cardboard car we managed to get VicRoads

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,130
to provide us with a hummingbird kit

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,830
it's Ned window based control system and

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,210
we began to start to program it we had

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,100
some software called snap that we could

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,510
integrate with that that allowed us to

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,490
actually do some of the hacking it was

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,159
necessary to make it work we wanted to

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:58,250
make a car that could move and think

00:17:54,159 --> 00:18:01,220
really exciting stuff this is the things

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,730
robot um it's kind of cute has little

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:08,150
blinky nose at the front and measures

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,710
light temperatures obstacles I know we

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,240
can do this with the Lego robotics what

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,130
was nice but you could kind of crack it

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,900
open and see all the circuits inside

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,010
because these are the kind of generation

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,090
the kids that if you ask them what's

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,559
inside of phone it's full of magic

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,059
because we don't actually open phones

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,190
you know we put them into the recycle

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,630
bin and that's it you guys might

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,940
remember pulling the power radios and

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,900
TVs and stuff this is generation it's

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,240
actually quite protective

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,390
from that it's protected by user

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,130
agreements and magic and I'd like to

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,720
think that I can maybe steer a

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,580
generation to take some of the mystery

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,460
way and give them a sense of control and

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,920
change and empowerment as some of the

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,690
coyote students did here and that was

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,660
quite fun this is using a scratch

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,570
interface scratch is a nice introductory

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,130
step I use it between the junior school

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,800
and the senior school will be step up to

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,310
using Python programming and that's

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,840
usually with the nccc programming

00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,130
challenge and some of the one or things

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,050
happening at a Sydney University what

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,310
was really nice was that some students

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,440
started to pick up things because we had

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,790
a bit of a freelance run of it one of

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,520
them is counted these problems he said

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,560
that thing stops working and this is

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,670
just revelation I figured it out it's

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,810
your stupid forever loop sir so how did

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,710
you figure it out he said I took him out

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:29,150
and he started the work and I realized

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,620
he okay and there's an iteration

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,140
probably a bit of a memory leak and then

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,140
just a widget just sucks itself up but

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,580
it was nice he discovered it himself

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,890
this was something that I had to learn I

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,080
think it was second to uni in the way I

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:49,160
was riding my code and he had actually

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,950
figured out himself at year 10 I don't

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,270
really think it was 10,000 lines of code

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,530
that's what something students popped in

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,240
the slideshow here this is the

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,390
hummingbird kit the way we'd kind of

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,370
assemble it we had the Arduino interface

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,470
we were keen on collision avoidance we

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,440
had the sensors they were made a bits of

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:10,100
wire we were inspired to actually build

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,230
a program our first vehicle and here's

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,410
the actual vehicle this was last year

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,880
the inspiration that we had we saw the

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,980
idea that we could just make all the

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,390
wires on the outside and make something

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,180
like that I've admitted the kids that

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,040
the lorry was my favorite car so we

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,420
started to make our own DeLorean here we

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,700
have about twenty dollar cardboard car

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,650
screwing on all the components oh this

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,810
is Dale Dale wasn't instant programming

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,650
but he loved engineering and we let him

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,650
loose on a hot glue gun

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,800
oh boy I had to learn the hard way he

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,540
glued everything in place that car was

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,340
going nowhere that wonderful kick was

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,560
never going to be reused again but it

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:52,340
was solid he said sir here you are

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:54,510
there's your DeLorean be happy oh gee

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,910
well we made it into the age newspaper

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,560
the girls were really engagement Tina

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,120
was fantastic I suddenly realized that

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,860
I'd been missing out them the best half

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,150
of the school was the impound with the

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,770
girls had and actually leading the team

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,030
together getting those boys to climb out

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,340
of their shells in the bedrooms and

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,540
actually be able to talk with each other

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,130
and collaborate on we had google

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,030
hangouts we'd sort of talk collaborate

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,920
plan build we actually came and we

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,260
bought the extra people in VicRoads a

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,210
code for your future programmer space

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,770
tanks to do makerspace the robotics

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,630
deputies I brought in everybody i had

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,250
and i think that one of the secrets i

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,080
have is that you can't do this kind of

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,430
stem stuff alone there are wonderful

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,400
partnerships that you can make with

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:34,110
different groups and I think that's

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
really powerful where Monash is making

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,720
the connection with the various

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,150
industries and enterprises and stem is

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,610
from my background not so much about

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,380
defining a subject in terms of science

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,300
technology engineering maps but it's

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,620
about stem principles of learning and

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,690
being able to apply that in each of the

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,150
different areas it's not a series of

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,270
acronyms or a bracket around a subject

00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:00,560
like humanities it's a process and way

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,480
of thinking and a principle of learning

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,040
we built a team together we a lot of fun

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,040
we learn a lot of different things along

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:12,240
the way but it ramps up and now I bring

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,310
you to hear you see we wanted to take it

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,370
one step further and to share and

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,170
challenges with other schools we

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,880
realized if you remember that original

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:25,140
mind map that it was actually much more

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,690
complicated the idea of a smart city was

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,180
where we were heading towards because

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,520
you may build an autonomous vehicle but

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,650
what makes it smart is when it talks to

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,720
other vehicles we couldn't do that the

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,970
Lego robotics but when it's time to talk

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,030
with other infrastructure and we could

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,280
do that because with the humming with

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,530
the mbot kits that would suddenly

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,419
stumbled across they allowed us to

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,730
actually use the infrared controller to

00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,960
of infrastructure I'll bring it to where

00:22:50,730 --> 00:23:23,220
we are now I'm just going to jump to a

00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:26,299
video maybe some ID is the bed Madilyn

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,559
data students with autonomous vehicles

00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:34,499
being able to think about collision

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:37,700
avoidance line dragging my sixth arted

00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:40,859
with building her own ebook very quickly

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,200
projects came aboard that exists a year

00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,460
ago such as the sparrow robots which

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,869
kind of the thought of as pedestrians

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,940
wandering around the track around the

00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:55,500
map

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:59,460
we also discovered please baby cupid em

00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,990
BOTS they difficult I did what we were

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,290
mucking around on Dale of his hot glue

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,540
gun these were a hundred and ten dollars

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,000
and they were assembled by the students

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,530
the circuit Ares naked expose and you

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,780
couldn't directly control the Arduino

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,280
Pro sauce on them I'm excited by some of

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,570
the ideas of being able to use Python at

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,680
this conference so make sure you have a

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,300
look at for some of the sessions there

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,030
we don't have to rely on just a scratch

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,800
in the face I think this is a really big

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,630
step forward for my group and then being

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,860
able to kind of program and code these

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,900
things to do the job that they need to

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,900
do but what I'm going to do with them

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:47,850
Edison's with other discovery sequence

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:52,500
and this is by putting Alou and then and

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:56,610
I love using a cloth as a means to stop

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,289
singer with program yeah so to program

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,630
you press this is the new preschool I

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:03,840
met they don't have any programming

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,510
classes they don't have a year 1112 IT

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,740
class and with some of the encode from

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,720
done with getting the kids excited about

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,580
coding and programming and I think it's

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,440
important for girls seeing how they can

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,220
make the world a better place by solving

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,809
problems this to me was really powerful

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,090
letting and play with it thinking about

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:23,070
it looking for the kind of ways we can

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,169
engage them they even made a smiley face

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,940
allowing them actually screwed robots

00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,240
together a chance to have some hands on

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:39,210
this technology understand how that's

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:40,740
our robot school just simply do running

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,600
these on a flat surface there's a

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,200
three-dimensional component that's where

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,000
these drones came in and the chance to

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,360
sort of think about our city in terms of

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,080
the 3d space of interactions between

00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:00,929
devices and infrastructure and vehicles

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:05,039
with the best dreams and we tried our

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:10,140
own challenges to some things were a

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:13,260
little crazy this was s master d chance

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,490
to sort of showcase at IITs 2016 so we

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,409
actually were invited to a conference

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,480
here in October with that same class and

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,890
with Dale and the other crew this is

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,799
what we're going to be showcasing in the

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:25,470
foyer outside amson ids conference we

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,850
want to show the makerspace and these

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,740
are the Smart City models that we're

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,450
making with factual buildings with LED

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,150
lighting and with little traffic light

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,380
control systems we have a makerspace we

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,730
want to show people how we do the

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,440
squishy electronics how we do the

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,080
wearable technology how we do the coding

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,820
as kids because it's a very different

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,350
playful approach in a way that we've

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,679
approached it in terms of stem learning

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,679
and engagement

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,960
what we could do to make that kind of

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,700
system that we dreamed of it VicRoads

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,500
build the kind of future of West Nile is

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:08,920
being a part of it was a game but it's

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:15,910
the real game we had some wins read some

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:19,660
failures best of all we make progress

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:23,910
and we learned a lot on the way which

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:28,660
schools in tolerance Brisbane and laid

00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:32,640
wa Melbourne or contributing their ideas

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:41,080
and these may be small victories

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:44,020
Brisbane Melbourne we also had the help

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,290
of Tony from code the future it was

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:51,720
fantastic gave us a sense of real

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:53,770
programming kept raising the bar and

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,050
provided us with some real-world links

00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:00,250
about our program is actually work event

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:03,960
consoled problems tony was the brains

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:07,480
trust for a group and gave a sense of

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,610
real time problem-solving to the kids as

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,380
they posed questions on the facebook

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:17,130
page many of the ideas might be buried

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:21,160
inside the code and inside a few boxes

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:24,450
but for us the journey was real about

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,380
learning the code learn the program

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,600
living to think about the kind of world

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:35,380
we might live in

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:42,580
as my city see what ideas now I know

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:43,990
that the go back here oops so let's say

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,030
a challenge was to build a smart city

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,590
involved schools and it's been exciting

00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,050
for us to be able to bring on board all

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,990
the different stakeholders and to scale

00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,880
it up I'm sort of teacher I have goofy

00:28:52,990 --> 00:29:00,100
fun with the kids but where I'm heading

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,350
is the future because if I'm serious

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,470
about engaging kids in the kind of

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,860
future that I'm going to be living in

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,080
then I want them to think about taking a

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,860
stake and being able to code it build it

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,390
ask questions about it be nice to your

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,710
students and your children because

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,710
they'll design and build the nursing

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,450
homes that will all reside and live in

00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,720
um oh it's a very different journey I

00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,800
hope you've enjoyed it I'll open up if

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,280
there's any questions you'd like to ask

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,630
me about the project it's a very

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,340
passionate one in case you're curious

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,170
you flip the maps / they become a Mars

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,030
terrain and so once we finished a smart

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:44,770
city they'll become a rescue mission for

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:47,530
Mars thank you well thank you Roland are

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,640
there any questions it was a lot in

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,930
there I imagine there's a lot of

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,930
questions all right start at the back

00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,480
what age groups do you find most

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,760
successful in engaging with this and

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,110
have you got experience with the kind of

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,700
grade six to nine range yes we have some

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,040
of the primary schools and then we'll

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,260
focus with using the sparrow robots and

00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,110
just doing the basic line tracking on

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:19,420
City construction so the older students

00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,560
the year nine and ten I think I'm more

00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,610
happy with them to actually start

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,530
actually doing some hard core

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,020
programming programmed the Arduino face

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,580
directly and consider how to use

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,980
infrared controller to communicate to

00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,270
infrastructure and one of the challenges

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,220
we have is actually doing that vehicle

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,710
to vehicle infrastructure we've got the

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,290
same problem two INTs has how do we

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:41,260
agree on an open standard for sharing

00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,730
information and once that is picked up

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,500
by the students they begin to see them

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,510
other ways that we do coding and

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,460
programming and I think that's a really

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,559
powerful learning lesson if I can share

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,910
that with the students because we don't

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,040
miss it it's not an easy problem to do

00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,140
we can't do it the lego robotics but we

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,840
can do at the end BOTS face up to it

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,640
we're only simulating and modeling that

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,870
problem solving process but I'm hoping

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,370
that they can take those lessons on and

00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,380
it's different for the older students at

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,179
year 10 then from perhaps the younger

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,900
students which is just solving problems

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:16,510
of how to navigate around a city another

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:20,410
question so you're obviously very

00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:23,470
passionate and very knowledgeable but a

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:25,750
lot of schools don't have people like

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,280
you and in particular don't have

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:33,220
supporting principles as well in your

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,799
journey and you've obviously changed

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:40,150
schools as well you just comment a bit

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:42,400
about the the resources needed teacher

00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,980
education principal education and sort

00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,559
of the future of the school system in

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,890
this in this regard I think it's really

00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:53,830
important to find partnerships you have

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,710
institutions like we had with the games

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,210
laboratory at RMIT with some of my past

00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,179
students have gone on to Monash

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:04,210
University maintaining a connection with

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:07,870
them also industry by providers like

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,570
VicRoads trans urban some of the parents

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,700
in a local area I'm trying to reinvent

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,440
themselves some are moving into

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,410
intelligent traffic systems bringing

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,710
them on board the idea that any one

00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,690
teacher holds the key to knowledge never

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,400
really going to happen but neither does

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,980
a principal and deciding perhaps where

00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,590
the real world is we call it the game

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,600
but it's the real game and its life I

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,520
don't pretend to have all the answers or

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,549
that all their cars are going to be

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,630
Arduino powered they're not in fact one

00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:39,340
of the things I picked up really quickly

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,350
was it when I went to other trans urban

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,880
guys did you guys are good at tough we

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,770
sit inside the vehicle of our laptops

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,720
and do the testing and we've got dozens

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,160
of computers you've only got one and you

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,210
have to try and just steer it from the

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,820
outside but the social issues are the

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,879
same and principals understand that the

00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,409
imperative to move

00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:59,269
way from a manufacturing base to perhaps

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,649
moving towards one it's based on smart

00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,319
technologies the principles do

00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,999
understand that and the idea that the

00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,559
stem principles of learning are really

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:09,859
powerful and they apply to a lot of

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,679
different subject domains that's not a

00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:14,419
hard sell but what when you do is

00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,069
actually give educators the opportunity

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,019
to find the points leverage to bring

00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:21,319
those outside experts in and help drive

00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,429
the change and i think that patient

00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,829
probably more important having all of

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:29,569
the knowledge and technics parties okay

00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:30,979
i'll just also note that like that's one

00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,539
of the reasons for the community

00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,979
partnership with code club because

00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:38,029
that's one of the big problems they're

00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:41,889
interested in helping to solve any more

00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:44,659
questions well people come back to you

00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,369
some really interested in that dynamic

00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:48,589
change you said with having the girls

00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:49,729
involved in the group just wondering how

00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:50,989
you met the challenge of actually

00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:54,229
getting the girls to engage with

00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,690
technology let them lead I think

00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:57,919
sometimes become of our own

00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,389
preconceptions about how boys because

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,819
I've taught a lot of boys for a long

00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:04,639
time and having goals in the classroom

00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:06,949
know does change dynamic sometimes

00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,869
they're quieter and more reserved and I

00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,490
have to find a point of leverage I have

00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:12,200
to shut the boy sir I've got tools and

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,750
ways of doing it I let the girls to work

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,069
together form a gig chikk klub and find

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,019
some good female role models from

00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:19,099
outside and just to tell the boys to

00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:21,619
shut up because they will tend the

00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,819
dominated I think and it's something

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:26,990
I've learnt now work in a girls school

00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:28,789
find the social mission why this will

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,799
make the world a better place to live in

00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,000
you can't I think have those

00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:33,289
conversations are just to be a great

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,450
career or you get lots of money

00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:36,950
guaranteed employment and it's not going

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,929
to work like that it's more a case of

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,700
this will make the world a better place

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,710
you're going to be able to use this to

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,569
actually drive change maybe make the

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,460
website for Greenpeace maybe actually

00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:48,740
design the medical system that will

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,599
replace the bionic ear or maybe the

00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,099
bionic eye I imagine a change that you

00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,599
can have or there's a group called

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:56,049
enable it does some wonderful staff

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,450
where kids are 3d printing their own

00:34:56,049 --> 00:35:01,009
prosthetic devices and that's something

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,980
I'm talking the principal abouts kicking

00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:06,920
off next year with program at the school

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,400
I met now that's powerful and that I

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,900
know finds traction of the girls and

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,190
and I think also as I said they've got

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,080
some great social skills and being able

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,670
to see the team rather than just the

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,200
selfish ego sometimes some of the boys

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,720
do and I'm being able to tap into that

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,970
knowledge i'm not expert at it but i

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,500
think if i'm open to different ways of

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,030
teaching and being an insensitive to the

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,300
needs then that's probably the best way

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,650
to move it forward but you're right

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,180
there's some intern gender issues i've

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:38,050
got a sort of work through and dynamics

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:40,330
there thank you okay so are you doing

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,460
this as part of your science class or is

00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:45,010
this extra time you've got for doing the

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,760
project the Smart City project I sneak

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:50,350
it in all over the place I managed to

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,850
convince all the fact I've convince the

00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,410
math teacher it's a mass predictive

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,210
convinced the technology to it's a

00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,860
technology and that's just a nature of

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,990
look when I was a science when I was

00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,060
working in research science no one

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,560
actually says you are a biochemist you

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,990
know what the hell are you doing in

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,880
explosives and was a case of actually me

00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,380
being sensitive to the when I was out of

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,390
my competency and the talk to people

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,340
about I need to solve a problem i have a

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,380
modeling problem with a borehole i need

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,510
to get some simulations I'm prepared for

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,160
doing that and then being able to

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,190
negotiate the mef stakeholders all the

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,360
IT stakeholders and I think that with

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,430
the way I'm doing it it's a bit of an

00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,870
extracurricular thing the bulk of it is

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,850
actually probably done with the year 10

00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:31,600
games programming class and with the

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,400
year 9 the rise of the robots class but

00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,530
the that's not to say that I don't have

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,200
signed students involved or I don't have

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,350
the mess the most kids involved yeah

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,210
thank you okay we'll probably wrap up

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,330
questions there Thank You rolas thank

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,330
