With the new national curriculum for Digital Technologies, there is a fantastic opportunity (and in some schools, need) to teach programming in conjunction with other learning areas. Python is an ideal first language, and there is a natural and deep relationship between mathematics and computer science.

We used the Python’s Turtle module (an implementation of Logo) to create resources that integrate the Year 7 Geometry topic and the basics of Python programming in a way that’s highly engaging for students. Learn about how we integrated the two subject areas and the results of our pilot run with a cohort of Year 7 students in NSW.

	00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,560
so before we start I want to tell you

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,810
about something that happened with my

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,870
housemate Chloe I still have lived with

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,840
housemates my housemate Chloe just the

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,630
day before yesterday and she's the final

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,010
year med student so I came home and I

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,980
asked her you know how is a day how's

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,699
hospital and she said uh it was awful I

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,560
went to surgery and at 6 a.m. and I

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,590
didn't have time to eat breakfast and

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,399
then after surgery there was like a

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,000
really urgent audit and I spent three

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,879
hours taking these scans of x-rays and

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,340
then cropping them and copying them into

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
a file and it was a really urgent audit

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,850
so I didn't have time to eat lunch

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,770
either and I looked at her and her and I

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,719
was like but you know you can do that

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:56,039
with programming and she said I know but

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,989
I can't write and I get friends in all

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,210
sorts of different fields in media and

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,329
doing you know scientific research in

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,439
law and they they come to me sometimes

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,070
and they say you know I have to do

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,680
programming in my job and they were say

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,070
two things they say I never realized I

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,810
need programming in my job and then they

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,939
always say and I really really really

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,350
wish that I'd done it at school just a

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,689
little bit so it wasn't so hard so good

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,150
news on that front the digital

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,960
technologies curriculum that's coming

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,270
briefs talks about this a little bit

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,720
earlier so right go into it too much but

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,750
it's being endorsed last year and it

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,189
covers kindergarten to 12 and different

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,610
states and territories are rolling out

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,500
over the next few years so I'm going to

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,759
be talking a bit more about year seven

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,439
later so just to give you an idea the

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,840
implementation part so just this is one

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,570
content descriptor in the curriculum for

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
year seven and eight says that they need

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,079
to be able to implement and modify

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,840
programs we use their interfaces so

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,149
input/output avoid involving branching

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,250
iteration and functions in a

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,770
general-purpose programming language so

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,039
this is text-based no more drag-and-drop

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,750
and they have to be able to you know do

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,960
if statements do loops and

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,840
right functions and if you think about

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,750
you know your seven student who's never

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,470
done programming before this is a really

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,060
big ask especially you know being taught

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,610
by a teacher who might not have done

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,340
programming before either so there are a

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,440
lot of challenges and we talked about

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,390
something earlier but one of the biggest

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,580
ones is that the curriculum is very

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,180
crowded so not just the digital

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,590
technologies curriculum but the whole

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,150
curriculum especially at a primary level

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,880
how many of you teachers in the room at

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,370
the moment yep

00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,780
would you agree yep

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,080
and it's basically impossible to fit it

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,930
all in especially a digitech knowledge

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,489
ease stuff unless you're covering it in

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,440
conjunction with other subject areas so

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,860
you're teaching a few of the content

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,980
descriptors at the same time and often

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,860
you know program is best taught in

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,160
context anyway so very few the students

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,560
actually will enjoy programming in and

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,440
of itself but you know if you show them

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,060
that it's a useful and valuable tool in

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,620
the areas that they're interested in and

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,120
that they will need this in the future

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,700
then you get a lot better engagement so

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,350
this is all very long good to say but

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,130
it's really hard to do in schools

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,260
because often subjects are siloed a lot

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,209
of schools lack you know experienced

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,620
teachers and the support in order to

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:55,290
implement all this and you know with the

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,970
schools running behind with with the

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,170
states who are running behind England

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,930
Wales we we really want to be able to

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,910
reach those students right now right the

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,100
the earlier they have you know a

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,290
foundation in programming the better it

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,590
is the easy level find it if you just I

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,829
mean I went to visit my old school this

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,079
year it's a girl school I won't say

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,299
which but I found out that they

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,130
basically did no programming whatsoever

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,720
so they did very little when I attended

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,520
but now they've dialed it back

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,039
so there's man

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,550
Tech in year seven but they do food Tech

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,560
and woodwork and they axe the nine and

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,169
ten nighty subjects and then they don't

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,569
offer the any any programming subjects

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,190
in eleven and twelve so this is the kind

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:48,810
of stuff that's going on and it's a

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:51,720
snobby private school so so one possible

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,210
solution that we're exploring at the

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,419
moment and several teachers came and

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,819
approached us about this is to teach

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,220
some programming in math sneak it into

00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,900
maths class and these teachers who

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,210
approached us obviously see the deep

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,539
connection between math and computer

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,729
science and there's also in the new

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,220
curricula there's lots of connections

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,110
between the two and so it's a really

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,750
great opportunity for authentic

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:23,039
integration which if we can pull off

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,370
properly can really engage students like

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,900
Moore in both subject areas so you're

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,400
gonna get the students who don't like

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,719
math because they don't see the point of

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,340
it you know all of a sudden they're

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:35,819
seeing all these real-world applications

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,229
and the rarer case of the student who

00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,990
really likes you know hacking at things

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,210
but hates maths because what's the point

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,789
you can also you know engage them as

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,190
well

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:51,090
they're the flipside of this integration

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:55,889
is that it's really hard to do you need

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,110
expertise in both subject areas and if

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,250
you're going to teach multiple things at

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,400
the same time you have to make sure

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,349
you're actually teaching both of them

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,810
and if it's done kind of in a half-baked

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:12,090
way the students can tell and it won't

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,469
help with your engagement so oh another

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,259
interesting thing that's happened is

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,960
that Victoria has added has basically

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:23,159
extended their maths curriculum to

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,759
include digital technologies e content

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:31,889
descriptors so exploring algorithms and

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:36,180
programming formats so what we wanted to

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:39,220
do was to develop resources that maths

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,130
teachers would find valuable to use with

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,440
maths classes so we could reach more

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,870
students and earlier age because you

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,870
know all students do maths up to you 10

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,530
so right before before we go on with

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,010
this

00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,780
what is logo slash this turtle thing

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,100
so here's heard of logo oh great

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,860
preaching to the choir

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,920
so it's this educational programming

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,800
language that was developed in 67 it was

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,490
really popular in 60s and 70s and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,400
originally there was this little robot

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,420
running around during shapes during

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,210
lines and so the Python total module is

00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,870
a reimplementation of this programming

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,460
language it's built into the the Python

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,720
standard library so you can just import

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,640
it it looks kind like this so you import

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,290
the total module and the turtle starts

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:43,419
off in the middle of the screen facing

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:45,190
to the right and you basically move the

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,450
turtle around it'll draw a line behind

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,919
it and the the syntax is really simple

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,190
and straightforward it does what you

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,720
expect so if you say forward 100 it'll

00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,190
move forward and draw a line a hundred

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,630
steps long so just note like all the

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,240
demos I'm going to show you in this talk

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,570
are in the grok landing platform because

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,460
that's where I work but puffin is

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,310
available sorry that the turtle module

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,860
is available for free you know it's part

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,360
of the standard library and everything

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm showing you I'm gonna show you is

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,390
also available to teachers for free and

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,650
then you can just take the problems

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,300
you're really you're more than welcome

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,250
to take the problems and then do them

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,770
with your students in class with them

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:31,169
running Python locally so yeah just

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,930
email me if you want to do that cool so

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:37,210
before the first thing we did was we

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,479
wanted to experiment and see if this was

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:45,220
an idea that would actually work so we

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,459
decided to put some some turtle problems

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,420
into an existing competition so I think

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,160
some of the teachers have talked about

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,660
the ncaa's challenge it's this

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,810
competition we run annually

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,579
behalf of the University of Sydney and

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,699
in the beginners stream there are eight

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:04,300
problems per week and we decided to make

00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,990
the last two of them total problems that

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,360
would also sneekly teach you geometry

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,779
and see if a students noticed

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,310
so that year 2015 we had about six

00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:20,829
thousand students and five hundred

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:29,050
teachers participating and going to do a

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:36,009
little demo let's see cool so the first

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:37,829
week we told them about angles so okay

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:40,689
so you're making the tunnel move forward

00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:43,480
but as soon as you want to draw a shape

00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:46,629
you need to turn the turtle and so right

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,329
off of that we've got this concept of

00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,220
angles as a change in direction of the

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,230
turtle so you've you've tethered this

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,300
concept of angles to this real thing

00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:05,170
that happens so you know that turning a

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:08,279
corner is 90 degrees right cool

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,959
and now you've drawn part of the square

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,069
but actually if you want to draw

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,329
anything besides a square or a rectangle

00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:19,630
you start needing to do angle

00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:23,199
calculations so say I want to draw a an

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,480
equilateral triangle so if I missed you

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,459
and I'll go along and think okay so the

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,870
angle in an equilateral triangle is 60

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:36,660
degrees so I'm gonna turn left go

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,660
forward and left this will work right

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,980
what's happened so the the angle that

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,100
the turtle needs to turn is not the same

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,230
angle as the internal angle the triangle

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,180
so you then need to start thinking about

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,839
the relationships between those angles

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,319
and you know supplementary angles are

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,319
useful

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,190
that's in the first week in the second

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,600
week we hit them with angles and

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,500
parallel lines and this is in the year

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,600
seven maths curriculum and even just

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,029
having this interactive diagram and

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,870
being able to see you know the different

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,100
pairs of angles and how it changes but

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,930
you know they stay the same when you

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,820
move moved around it's a different way

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,580
of presenting that information to

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,820
students and the final problem in this

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,830
week was actually really hard so the

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,230
problem was the user would enter an

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,440
angle and then you would have to draw a

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,120
tea that was tilted by that amount so

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,839
the angle is 90 it's a it's a regular

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,140
tea with 90 degree angles but if the tea

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,400
if the user enter is a different angle

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,810
you need to italicize the teeth right

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,160
how many of you are confident doing this

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,160
question if I asked you the color

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:07,040
oh I don't I'm gonna try and do this but

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:10,700
I don't have enough time but I'm what's

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,380
often useful with this is that a lot of

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,060
time we'd tell the student you know draw

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,950
it on a piece of paper like draw the

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,510
dotted line whether the turtle would

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:22,220
keep moving and you know you know like

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,320
mark out the angles that you need to

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,720
turn and when you draw it out it looks a

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,820
lot like those boring you know parallel

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
line diagrams that you're you're drawing

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,970
in maths class but all of a sudden has a

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,730
purpose you know you need it tight Alice

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:40,850
sighs you know vector fonts so week

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:44,630
three we've got angles at a point and at

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,610
this point they've learned looping in

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,050
terms of programming concepts so they're

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,790
using a for loop to draw squares around

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,760
a point and they need to do the angle

00:12:52,790 --> 00:13:00,050
calculation to figure out how much to

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,770
turn after each Square week for exterior

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,770
angles of a polygon

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:10,070
did you know exterior angles of a

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:12,410
polygon add up to 360 degrees you can

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,329
remember it because in order to get

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,050
peddle back around to where it started

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:21,500
you need to turn the whole circle of 360

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:25,670
degrees and this is my favorite question

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,560
so coordinates and the number plane so

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,600
this is getting pretty advanced at this

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,550
point I don't think coordinates I think

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:38,120
the number plane comes in until year

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:40,189
eight or nine but in this problem we're

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,879
basically giving them some coordinates

00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:46,879
and we're asking them to draw it on one

00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,800
side and flip it across the y-axis so

00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,170
they have to make the x coordinate

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,160
negative and the cool thing where this

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,290
problem is that you know you can just

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,910
give them coordinates and with the same

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,279
solution they're drawing really cool

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:08,089
shapes and I've got the solution in here

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:18,649
because I did this one spent two hours

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:20,870
of my life so at this point the students

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,279
are using I mean so they've got they're

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,199
reading a string they need to break it

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,730
up into an array there you looping over

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:30,740
it and then at the same time they need

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,250
to understand these math concepts with

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:38,209
the the number plane right and so we're

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:40,220
getting pretty advanced and it's a real

00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,649
marriage of the two subject areas that

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:48,980
creates like a really interesting and

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:52,579
challenging problem so that was the

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:59,480
challenge that year and we had I know I

00:14:52,579 --> 00:15:01,009
full-screen this again so that was half

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,800
of the problem so we had ten problems

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:06,019
total to two problems a week over five

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,750
weeks so let's see what the students

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,220
thought it was amazing I love

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,050
programming to make shapes and pictures

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,459
but don't ask me to redo them because

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,459
they're very hard to work out how to do

00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,329
it felt nice when I got them right

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,250
because I'm weak at math

00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:24,680
this was a response that we really

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,300
wanted to hear and it's very nice I

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,950
would much rather write

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,140
the programs will stab folks in my eyes

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:40,610
and do anymore total questions that is

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:42,680
also a fair response so overall we had

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,330
388 students respond to the survey

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,420
question about whether they liked the

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:52,840
turtle questions and the answer overall

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:55,610
is yeah so what did the teachers think

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,990
Rob said it was engaging more enjoyable

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,460
as you could see when incorrect

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,220
instruction was drawn out with a turtle

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,680
so you're visually seeing what's gone

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,460
wrong rather than like a cryptic error

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,140
message as much as I like them students

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,100
tended to get hung up on the mathematics

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,570
of the questions rather than the

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,070
programming and at the beginner level

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,750
this often caused the students to get

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,700
disheartened with the programming side

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,730
of things so this was a really common

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,250
concern we had about the difficulty of

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,700
the maths or even students negative

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,930
perceptions of maths you know turning

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,830
them away from the programming as well

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,450
so okay

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,620
who said personally I hated the total

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,060
but that's because I can get my mind

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,590
around it it was great for students

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,790
however and I had a maths found some

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,060
great connections with vectors and

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,980
angles which is good because that's what

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,660
we were going for so overall this was 80

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,390
teachers who responded to this question

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,440
and they liked the turtle questions more

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:58,520
than this chance did nobody hated it

00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,110
oh and also on the survey I think 18

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:07,730
students said that they didn't realize

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:10,360
they had been doing maths so ever all

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,770
would be learned is generally positive

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,890
this problem about the math being too

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,230
hard was aggravated by the large range

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,630
of Ages that we have participating in

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,720
the beginners challenge so I think five

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:27,350
to 12 and this works right now for

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,240
programming it works ish because you

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,650
know lots of students in five to twelve

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,570
have exactly the same amount of

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,290
experience programming which is zero

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,860
right but this isn't the case with maths

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,410
there's a really clear sequence and it

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,610
you know taught in schools from a young

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:48,309
age so what we wanted to do next was

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:53,230
develop resources that were just for a

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:55,270
specific year so a year seven maths

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,160
course and we had 59 teachers on the

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,860
survey say they'd be interested in

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,840
working with colleagues to trial this

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,990
course so we took that as a sign to go

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,960
ahead

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:10,660
so this years of maths course this is

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,480
released online free for teachers so you

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,520
can go on and check it out but you need

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,280
to request a teacher trial so you can't

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:24,970
do it right at the moment but yeah just

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:26,350
email me if you want access so we made a

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,780
few decisions about the course based on

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,850
the feedback we got it was tallied 87

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,760
and it was tied to both the maths and

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:38,440
the digital technologies curriculum for

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,620
year 7 and we explicitly teach the math

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,460
concepts more so in the challenge it was

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,549
more of a case of using maths concepts

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,010
to solve programming problems and in

00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:54,790
this course it's more using programming

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,460
to explore maths concepts right and we

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,530
slowed to write down so the first two

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,140
weeks of the challenge basically we

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:06,070
expanded out into six modules we doubled

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,610
up the problems and it only covers the

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,950
programming covers basically you know

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:15,940
input output variables you know strings

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,049
and number ins and if statements so

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,570
that's how far we got in those six

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,770
modules and when we developed the course

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:27,070
we actually had a really enthusiastic

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:30,790
maths teacher who wanted to try it out

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:33,870
with his entire year 7 cohort so this

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:37,450
was 91 students across four classes and

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:39,460
but the for maths teachers I don't think

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,500
any of them had any big experience

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,140
coding and we went into the school and

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,120
we met with them a few times and ran

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,710
them through the courses but you know

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,040
teachers very busy and they didn't have

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,630
time to do to prep that either so the

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,000
classes ended up

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,280
pleading one two three modules over

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,510
three periods depending on the level of

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,320
the class and if you I mean if you look

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:08,110
at the progression a lot of so the first

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,120
two modules are basically just you know

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,010
the basics of programming getting input

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,880
from the user how to times things

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,560
together using Python so that means a

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,310
lot of students didn't even actually get

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:26,560
to the the turtle bit which is a bit sad

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:27,910
and then they you know had assessments

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,790
that they needed to do and they were

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,870
worried about the time you know how much

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,400
time they had left to teach maths

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:37,560
because they thought it didn't have

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,840
enough math in it which is totally fair

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,610
so it's really hard to do any

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,460
interesting problems when you don't have

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:48,340
that grounding that basic foundation in

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,680
programming and this will get better in

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,330
the future as more students you know go

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,850
through the curriculum and start

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,370
programming from a younger age but right

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,320
now

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,910
it's not helping so math teachers are

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,670
concerned about not getting enough time

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,090
to teach their curriculum and getting

00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:12,640
the balance right is really hard but

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:14,740
we're try let's see so what's happening

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,950
right now is that we released the course

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,770
on the website last week and we email

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,340
teachers to see if they'd be interested

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:28,480
in in trying out with more students and

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,430
so we heard maybe a dozen teachers email

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,130
back so far and we've got two new

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,950
classes signed up and the difference in

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,830
this these cases is that it's interested

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,480
math teachers or you know people

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,420
contacting us on behalf of you know

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,370
they're interested maths colleagues so

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,720
the math teachers themselves again those

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,120
teachers themselves are going to be

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
delivering the content to their students

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,530
so hopefully that'll work a little bit

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,050
better and on our end I'm working to you

00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:01,300
know shift the balance towards math even

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:03,790
more because we we really want math

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,880
teachers to find valuable for teaching

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:11,890
their curriculum as well

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:17,320
and what we need to do is just slow down

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:19,000
the the programming and you know for for

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,910
the current situation and then just

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,140
adapt it as students get more and gain

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:29,740
more experience in younger years

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:32,140
programming cool sir yes this is what I

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,760
talked about digital technologies news

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,380
integration so the the main summary

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,390
point I had here was that through this

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,850
whole process working with teachers has

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,610
really been invaluable because obviously

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:47,590
I'm not out in the schools teaching and

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:50,710
I'm not a math teacher so if you know

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,480
you want to if you're interested in any

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,330
of this or if you have a similar

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,520
experience integrating you know across

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:04,990
subject areas I'd really like to hear

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:13,480
from you thank you very much thank you

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:16,000
do we have questions thanks Vivian I saw

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,290
the clear application of looping what

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,710
about tests as in ifs where were they in

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:32,730
range so things like let me show you

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:32,730
naming ankles so where are we going

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:45,580
right so things like naming angles or I

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:48,270
think we're drawing angles in different

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:57,480
colors depending on whether they're

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:57,480
obtuse or acute yeah any more questions

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,220
so I had a couple of questions

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,220
um the first with the survey results of

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,930
these students with the challenge what's

00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,520
that just of all students or were you

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,120
able to get a gender breakdown of

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,580
results yeah so we we do have a gender

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,080
breakdown let me see if I can i took

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,100
their names off but let me see if I can

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,040
remember who they came from if you're

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:32,270
interested I can show you more feedback

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:39,020
I mean we had like 300 400 responses and

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:43,820
I just picks about the first one was

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:52,030
male the second one was female and I

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:55,550
didn't check the third one when I you

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:59,090
considering doing similar integrated

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:02,390
courses curricula for younger students

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:07,130
as well that's I think it's further down

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:10,040
the road map with the tech specs so the

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:14,630
other thing that we have done is we've

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,460
got turtle programming using blockly so

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,800
you've got drag and drop blocks instead

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,750
and that works really well we have the

00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,760
students so we've got a couple of

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:31,070
activities that use that any more

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:33,610
questions okay

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,610
