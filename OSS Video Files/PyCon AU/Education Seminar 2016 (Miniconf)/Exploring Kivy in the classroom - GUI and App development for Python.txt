Title: Exploring Kivy in the classroom - GUI and App development for Python
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Education Seminar 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Amanda Hogan
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/88/view_talk
Graphical User Interface with Python is a tricky business. Come and learn a bit about Kivy and learn about my successes and failures using it with my Senior Software Development students (in NSW) to introduce GUI and App development with Python. 
In this workshop you'll be introduced to the Kivy library, the tagging and formatting in kv files, setting up the python classes to support the UI and passing parameters between them.
The workshop is not really suitable for the Python beginner because we need to play around with classes and methods (one of the challenges with using it in the classroom) but will otherwise be a fairly measured pace.

okay for a second talk this session I'd

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,189
like to welcome Amanda Hogan and is the

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,840
ICT integration coordinator and

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,240
computing teacher at Tara Anglican

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,460
school for girls she's taught computing

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,779
for the last eight years and ICT

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,170
integration for the last five she's the

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,289
recipient of the 2015 ICT New South

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,990
Wales ICT Teacher of the Year award is a

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,429
Google certified innovator and she's

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,439
also a regular volunteer and content

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:40,980
creator for for the girls programming

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:43,710
network okay so and this is more of a

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,750
chat than it is a multi slide

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,700
presentation I'm gonna do some

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,280
show-and-tell I'm gonna tell you about

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,199
our story basically the problem we're

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,930
trying I'm trying to solve with this

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,360
with this chalk is lots of people use

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,690
Python but then what do you do for you

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,549
why because it is a syllabus requirement

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,740
for most of our curriculums and so yeah

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,200
Tim covered quite a lot of the different

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,520
options and I'm gonna cover one that in

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,259
detail and it is bumps and all I'm going

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,610
to tell you that what we love about it

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,189
and what's great and what's really

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,240
working for us and on the other hand I'm

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,400
gonna tell you what drives me mad so

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,369
this is the plan for what's happening I

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,920
am a computer science graduate a million

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:38,700
years ago and then I've worked in

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:41,400
industry and 11 nearly no three twelve

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,860
years ago I had a kid and got out of IT

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,290
and decided to I had all this maternity

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,299
leave I'll just go get my dip ed and so

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,390
I went into teaching it was all a bit of

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,490
a confluence of things but but I like

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,850
the fact that I'm I'm in a girls school

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,969
I'm trying to make a difference and what

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,770
viv said earlier was really true I'm at

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,799
that one of those snotty private girls

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,140
schools and when using the girls in

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,950
droves we had a bit of a bump for a

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,020
while where we're computing was cool and

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,740
parents were pushing girls to be like

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,810
their brothers

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,150
and it's really dropped and I don't know

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,510
why I think maybe it's because they take

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,280
laptops to school and so if you use a

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,020
laptop everyday then clearly you know

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,770
about computing so you don't have to

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:33,060
study computing you do it and that's

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:36,890
really false anyway so we have this

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,500
really we had this really lousy rate of

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,040
students taking subject in 11 and 12 and

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,800
about five or six years ago my head of

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,270
department at the time was told we're

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,850
probably going to have to kill software

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,920
and it's a very common story across lots

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,250
of girls schools if you can't get the

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,240
numbers you can't warrant the time and

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,000
so he and bless him ran around trying to

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,140
work out what the heck he could do to

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,180
fix this and that was he developed is he

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,880
took some grant money and developed an

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,650
online course so our software design for

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,600
New South Wales and yes I I'm in the

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,450
state that has not yet adopted the

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,240
digital technologies curricula

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,090
our our software design course is an

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,130
online course and if the girls are at

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,930
Terra then they're in my classroom and

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,720
if their girls or boys anywhere else in

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,010
the state then they can log in to used

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,080
to be Moodle we've just implemented

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,390
canvas but into a website a web

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,200
interface that then has week by week

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,870
activities and we heavily use grok

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,710
learning it's kind of our virtual

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,440
textbook and then they submit things to

00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,660
me and I give them feedback it's hard

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,490
it's hard for those kids that are away

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,410
just because they don't have that

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,340
constant feedback of what they're what

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:06,090
they're doing wrong and so that's a bit

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,990
of where we came from and I think that's

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,240
where why we ended up with Kibby because

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,550
before that before that we implemented

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,950
the online course five or six years ago

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:25,320
we were using Adobe flex that died its

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:26,530
own death and we're also using VB and we

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,420
first of all they

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,570
the old technologies they're really old

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,210
thinking and the kids were being really

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,790
fixated on the UI and not so much on

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,100
what they were doing and solving the

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,660
problem and so that's a negative but on

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,389
the other side it's also licensing

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,490
issues and so you can't have students

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,910
join your course from a different school

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,560
who has different technologies if they

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,360
have to then we have to solve that

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,860
problem of Licensing across schools it

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,820
was just going to be a nightmare so we

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,460
need an open source and so then that's

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,290
when we implemented Python just for 11

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,780
and 12 to start with and then we've

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,720
pushed it back down into 9 and 10 I

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,630
think it's great I agree with everything

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,820
everybody said today that it's it it

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,480
follows pseudocode really closely it's

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,610
good for layout and ensuring that the

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,530
girls sorry I'm gonna say girls a lot

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,350
because I'm a girl's school teacher but

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,020
the students makes them format properly

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,540
makes them think about you know is this

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,330
inside the if statement or is it outside

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,870
that kind of stuff pythons great but UI

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:42,750
is terrible and I'm going to show you

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:48,090
something this is I have hello world for

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,950
take inter I've lost it there it is

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,350
so hello well fatique inter is really

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:58,180
really quick it's only three lines um

00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:02,770
it's it's really easy to do it's a great

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,260
jump in but it's ugly it's really ugly

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:10,330
it's worse than VB that's like they

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:13,360
didn't think that was possible so so you

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,320
don't hook girls with ugly you just

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,380
don't yeah so I needed something pretty

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,120
and we looked at we looked at the

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,960
options we looked at tkinter we looked

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,940
at we looked at high game which you can

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,100
use for games it's great we use it in 9

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,720
and 10 now for game development but

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,289
actually the girls kind of grow out of

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,110
games faster than boys do and so they

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,780
get to you 10 and they're like another

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,090
game and so when they get to you 11 and

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,160
12 them like we must solve the problems

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,690
of the world and so they don't want to

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,040
do a game anymore they want to actually

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,340
have a real problem that they're solving

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,620
so pi game really is i know you can make

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,170
UI with it but it really is sprite based

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,840
it really is game II and even when you

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:02,680
make a menu system in it it still looks

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,240
like PI game so this is the hello world

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:13,030
for keavy which is what we're going to

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:15,490
be talking about right so it's a bit

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,170
longer and it's got a big problem in the

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:27,970
middle of it and I'll talk to that later

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:31,390
but it allowed it just blew it does an

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,880
automatic resize the button fills the

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,830
screen wherever it is you know it's

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,930
prettier and actually that's a really

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,410
big thing with girls I know that

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,480
shouldn't be but it is so that's where

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,480
we ended up with kitty and that was four

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:52,050
years ago i implemented Kitty into year

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:55,510
11 and I had no idea what I was doing

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,610
I'd done some tutorials I'm like I've

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,350
been Python coding for five years now

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:07,540
I'll be fine oh my goodness so it was a

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:10,150
steep learning curve this is the native

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,850
it was one of the native tutorials that

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,770
comes with kitty which is actually

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:19,780
really nice but it's not one of the ones

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,890
I use anymore and there's reasons for

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,800
that and I'll explain in a second so

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:29,500
it's just a cute little paint app and

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,410
you can do it in not very much code and

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,690
it's touch enabled so they've got

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,880
surfaces which means that they can feel

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,280
like they're actually making an app

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,900
because they could imagine it being on a

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,410
phone or a tablet sometime in the future

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:49,660
and that's a big thing about kitty okay

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,550
so we got to this point and then we had

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,310
to do with classes

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,440
and classes are great when you're a

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,850
coder when you really do program when

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,310
you've done so yes

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,290
classes aren't the solution to so many

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,920
problems but it's not really in our

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,360
syllabus and it's a huge learning curve

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,290
it's it was massive

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,820
and I regularly have year 11s in tears

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,139
girls cry

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,690
boys tend not to girls do so the fact

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,510
that they had to get their head around

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,670
how objects worked and stuff like that

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,100
it just to follow a tutorial has been

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:31,510
really hard the good thing about classes

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,510
and there is a good thing

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,730
once they persist with it it really

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,089
makes them think about what behaviors

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,260
are attached to that screen or that that

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,870
thing that they're trying to do that

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,570
button you know what am I actually what

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,240
is it own what does it what does it do

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,829
and then write functions and functions

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,480
are in the syllabus and are really

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,519
important and they need to know how to

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,610
do it and to be honest when they do

00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,730
Python even in tech space in Idol there

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:04,569
they're still doing they're still using

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,910
objects you know they're using methods

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:10,029
and and they're assigning attributes and

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,889
they just have to think about the link

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,440
between what am i doing what have I done

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:18,069
in grok this week and how does that

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:23,940
relate to a class or an object yeah so

00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:28,720
we've persisted with it I just have oh I

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:32,829
just want to show you the thing that

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:38,800
we've been doing as take to introduction

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:43,030
to key be with you 11 and it's not open

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,960
please be open ah I

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:49,600
so first I ran it QB I ran a tutorial

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,290
based from the website kiva.org great

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,420
has some great resources has a really

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,900
good database of what their stuff does

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,500
so you can really read what every single

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:06,900
widget does and all of its behaviors in

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:10,420
detail girls don't read kids don't read

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,460
but this is what we did for take two

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,890
so rather than it being a tutorial where

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,550
they're following along all they tended

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,950
to do was copy huge chunks of code from

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,290
the screen that had the tutorial into

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,300
their Idol window window and then go ah

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,740
it didn't work I don't know why and

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,420
because they hadn't really thought about

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,780
what each of the lines was doing though

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,380
they weren't really synthesizing what

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,880
they were doing so take two on this

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,240
which has been much more successful

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,980
which is I get the girls at the

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,650
beginning of the year we have an

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,850
incursion and we invite the external

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,339
students in it and that's really

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,790
valuable because it kind of forms some

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:55,900
class cohesion some of them can't come

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,180
we open up a hangouts or something if

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,660
they can if they can make it a whole day

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:04,210
online though is pretty full-on

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,060
anyway we do an incursion just on QB

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,339
just so that at the end of the day

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,290
they've they've made something we've

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,860
made something as a class and this is

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:17,380
the only thing we do as a group and

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,020
that's a shame but it's it's kind of the

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,510
nature of an online course and also the

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,730
nature of an eleven twelve course in

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,380
that it tends to be competitive and

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,940
you're trying to do rankings our class

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,900
sizes are really small which is why

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,700
they're online in the first place and so

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,190
it's really nice to kick off year eleven

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,930
with something where they're working as

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,370
a team so we do a really lousy scope at

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,100
the beginning I tell them that we're

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,800
going something that has to have buttons

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,839
has to have interaction has to have two

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,620
screens and then they come up with an

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,410
idea and then they and with a lot of

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,240
help from me build that idea and it's

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,880
it's really simple it's a simple idea

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,350
but it's not it's not a major work by

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,610
any stretch of the imagination but it's

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,270
a tutorial that they're building

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,860
themselves as they go and so how do I

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,560
make a button on the screen well who's

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,370
going to research that and so this is

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,370
what we came up with

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:26,650
did I mention girls like pretty so we

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:29,680
have we have a childhood app app which

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:33,580
could be put on a tablet in theory iOS

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,540
but I don't have any and when you click

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,760
on the animal

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,620
oh it's failed good okay in theory when

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,570
you click on the animal it worked this

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,130
morning when you click on the animal

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,220
that opens up a second screen which

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,800
shows you a photo of the animal what the

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,070
what the animals sound is and what the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,600
animals name is so that you can you know

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,560
it's for a learning app for a young

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,280
child but having a scope that they get

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,050
to have input into I've got templates

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,630
for a lot of this stuff that we're

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,240
altering it really works to introduce

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,530
them into the into the language and then

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,990
they're meant to comment the code

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,430
extensively so that when they do come to

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,560
the next assignment which they have to

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,630
do individually they've got these

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,730
building blocks that they can then slot

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,380
together and really what is programming

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,800
but building blocks that you're sliding

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,620
together it's I know that there are big

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,360
problems being solved with entirely

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:38,200
unique thinking but it's usually not

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:43,080
happening in your 11 or 12 ok yes I want

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,080
to kill it it didn't work ok

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,769
sorry no no no I

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,070
it wasn't because of sound it wasn't

00:14:52,769 --> 00:15:01,639
actually changing screens but thank you

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:06,269
okay so then what are our pros and cons

00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:08,910
there are some big pros one is this this

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:12,600
is a kv file and it's what QB was named

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:16,980
after and it allows you to use this kind

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:21,000
of weird tagging language to define what

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,570
bits go where and then your behaviors

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,850
are inside the pi file which is

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:30,360
class-based and functions it allows you

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,420
to keep the UX up away from the

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,000
programming which is actually good it's

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,980
good thinking in theory you could come

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,380
along and reskin the thing and it would

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,380
it would just work because it's just

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,790
opening this one Cavey file and I think

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,519
that's brilliant and I think it's it's

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,320
good practice to teach the girls it

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,199
means that their code works regardless

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,690
of the UI and they could you know in

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,970
theory take it to a website or take it

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,160
to something else or do it in PI game it

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,790
all just is going to behave the same way

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,769
so that's really big the other thing is

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,610
that is free it's really important

00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:11,940
because I've got external students and

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,880
so with the with those two things as

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,889
being and it's pretty which is not to be

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,889
underestimated with those three things

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:22,620
as that's why we're still persisting but

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:24,420
there are some negatives and I'm going

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,610
to walk you through some of them the

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,790
class thing is a really big problem I

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:33,870
know that people use classes all the

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,209
time girls tend to be a bit tentative

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,760
well my students tend to be a bit

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,980
tentative they want to be told how to do

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,870
stuff rather than go and play with stuff

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,300
so they see classes which they've never

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,130
heard of before at the beginning of year

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,089
11 and they start asking if they should

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:53,310
dump this subject which is really unfair

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:55,050
but it just means that we've got to get

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,830
them over that hump and so there's a lot

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,830
of hand-holding in year 11 there is a

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,140
option topic in software design that you

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,450
can you can learn something about class

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,589
objects object-oriented programming is

00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,930
in there

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,420
it's not part of the core and it's

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,550
really tangental II mentioned so it's

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,010
it's not really worth doing the option

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,370
topic to try and take use of the class

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,520
of the objects I think that when digital

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,589
technologies someday it comes to New

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,390
South Wales and it gets pushed out from

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,670
underneath you eleven and twelve are

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,440
going to have to change and the best way

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,590
for that it to change is to incorporate

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,630
objects more in a more real way and so I

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,280
think that it's it's a good direction to

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,690
be heading and when they go to uni

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,180
they're going to have to do this stuff

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:49,490
anyway but there is some freak out at

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:53,130
that begin stage the next problem is

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:58,650
first when I first implemented Kibby we

00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:01,770
had Python 2 point and QB only worked

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,600
with Python 2 it's now changed it's been

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,000
updated so it now works with Python 3

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,770
and that's a big few for us because we

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,290
use grok learning and we use all of

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,270
these resources that are Python 3 and so

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,260
game they're kids to walk run two

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,730
implementations of Python and also like

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,860
they're still learning a language to

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,200
translate between two is is really

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,060
frustrating and so brackets being in the

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,890
wrong place and print statements and

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:32,550
they'd start to cry so that's that like

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,860
great that's fixed awesome the problem

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,420
is that the first time we did this the

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,040
you twelves actually had an app to take

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,450
home they can take home one of the

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,400
school's tablets and show their parents

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,930
their app they could bring in dad's

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Android phone because girls don't have

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,720
Android and and they could download it

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,090
to that apk to that and they could run

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,240
it you know they actually could have

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:58,530
real implement to their app it is

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,070
extraordinarily hard to do this actor to

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:05,600
do that apk creation with Windows and

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:09,000
Python 3 and Kivu whatever we're up do

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,840
it's just it's just inordinately hard I

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,880
don't have terminal so downside

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,230
all of the all of the code is written

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,320
for terminal and then sometimes

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:23,429
converted to a command prompt and I'm

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,830
not clever enough to work out how to do

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,990
that and so we had a bit of a

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,380
disappointing end to the project this

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,210
year where they had got their stuff

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,150
working and I'm about to show you them

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,669
but they they just couldn't get it to

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,190
that last final step of having an apk

00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,049
which is a real shame I mean it didn't

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,510
affect their marks it wasn't in the

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,000
marking guide but it affects their sty

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,590
key it affects their emotional

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,140
attachment to this project that they've

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:57,330
worked on for months ok so the other

00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,940
thing the other thing and you might see

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:05,730
any evidence of it in the project is

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:11,279
that the the girls tend to think rigidly

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:15,120
in boxes and layouts QB is a lot built

00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:17,940
UX and so everything is hierarchical in

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,740
nature and the buttons go neck to

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,990
buttons and that makes things easy and

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,460
that that's why I like the kV file but

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,320
at the same time it does limit your

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,230
thinking and so all the storyboards I

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,730
had was just a grid of boxes and I just

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,830
wish that they could see some

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,380
flexibility there it is possible to be

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,320
flexible but it reminds me of back in

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,179
the day when I was doing HTML pre css3

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,919
and everything was in a frame or a table

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:47,429
that's how they think that everything's

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,690
laid out in a table so that's a bit of a

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,279
downside but it's not

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,529
none of these downsides are big enough

00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,390
for us not to be continuing with this

00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:58,580
we're excited by it it's it's a really

00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:00,720
cool way of making UI for pythons ah

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:07,140
despite those couple of drawbacks

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:09,289
so now show-and-tell time yeah okay the

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,750
girls get to choose what they want to do

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:14,789
there is a whole lot of

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:18,779
choose-your-own-adventure in year 12 and

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:21,210
this there are some criteria that they

00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,250
have to meet and the biggest one is that

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,500
they have to do file processing it's

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,200
always in the HSC they have to know it

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,120
and so

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,410
I figured that it's best to put it in

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,210
the assignment that they live and

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,230
breathe for several months rather than

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:41,560
just learning it in the classroom so

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:45,850
please work this time right so this is I

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,740
really like I really like these girls

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,870
believed in their projects that they

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,090
chose them that they decided that this

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:56,290
was a problem that needed solving and

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,760
this one is I'm really disorganized and

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,740
then there are two that are very like

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,910
this I'm really disorganized and I need

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,290
something that's going to keep me

00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:11,110
organized so she has a way of adding

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:16,840
tasks with due dates and she just got up

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:19,300
and down buttons and names and whether

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,020
it's urgent or important or necessary or

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:27,990
optional and and then she can just set

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:31,690
it and so then it actually when the app

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,630
first opens it goes and checks what's in

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,090
the table it's just it's just a text

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,150
file so just in the text file it opens

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:44,080
it up it pulls it into a dictionary it

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:47,820
then adds to the dictionary or adjusting

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:52,720
so see this is what I mean by the

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:59,320
everything's a table okay

00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:05,140
next one we should have ordered these

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,780
better okay this one I think I might

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,760
I'll do a really quick showing of the

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:17,590
other one and then I'll show you the

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:20,470
last one yep okay so this one does a

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,060
better job of the layout okay they

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,070
didn't turn off their print statements

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,810
that we're doing the Jude debugging for

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,760
them awesome okay so it comes in jumps

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,310
into a screen that shows her what's

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,470
overdue it not everything was overdue

00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:38,770
when she submitted it but his time has

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,200
passed and then she can add a new

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:44,520
she can go to the calendar view to see

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,390
what's on what day it's it's pretty cool

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,570
she she found a she found a calendar

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:55,030
picker app a plugin and she asked me if

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,980
she could use it and and she can't in

00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,870
year 12 you can use it you just have to

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,810
document where you got it from and make

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,520
sure that the IP is covered and then we

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,850
worked out that it was for Python 2 in

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,580
QE and not Python 3 and B so complete

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,280
fail so instead of crying this is one of

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:16,060
the more resilient children and she she

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:21,940
went home and wrote her own so I was

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:24,070
proud very proud and the last one this

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,370
is the one that I really particularly

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,740
like the problem she was trying to solve

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:33,730
does anybody know what X is

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:35,650
it's the girls school sports thing and

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,360
so you go to each so to find out where

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,410
you're playing in hockey this week or

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,840
whatever she had had enough of going to

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:46,240
exile and having to download the CSV and

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,660
open it and find out which so she just

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,370
went and wrote an app that would allow

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,680
you to choose which school you're from

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:57,070
which team you're in and to go and

00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:04,690
scrape versus fee for your games that's

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:07,900
a real problem and I wrote and it I

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,670
really liked how q does resizing but it

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,290
does a really lousy job of labels could

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,520
you see that did you see how the label

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,140
yeah great yeah so that's my Show and

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
Tell and that's why we're sticking with

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,270
Kimmy and thank you very much there any

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,270
questions

00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:40,209
teacher voices say your students here's

00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:41,889
the visual editor for kiddie at all have

00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:45,999
you had a look at the visual editor I

00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:47,199
had a look at it it was a lot of the

00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:49,929
stuff had already been written by the

00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:53,859
time the visual editor came around and

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:56,709
so yeah it's a time thing I have to sit

00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:59,199
down and work out how to work with it

00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:08,789
with the year 11s and I'll do it up for

00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:12,579
next year is the pipette installation

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:15,359
straightforward installing Kibby yeah

00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:17,919
yeah we've said a lot of troubles with

00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,729
getting dependencies and such with other

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,169
systems that all yeah they um it wasn't

00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:27,879
it was really ugly and you had to

00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:32,349
especially in Windows you had to send to

00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:34,839
a kivi batch file to make it run and

00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:36,849
that was driving everybody crazy right

00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:39,940
clicking and going to send to we learnt

00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:41,589
the keyboard shortcuts really fast to to

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,559
compile it every time we need to run it

00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:48,999
but they you just saw that this was

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,739
running from idle so there's some you

00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:52,419
have to go through the command prompt to

00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:54,609
do the install and there's some pip

00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:56,799
stuff in there that is a bit beyond me

00:26:54,609 --> 00:27:00,599
but um if it just follow the line by

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,599
line instructions and it's pretty good

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:08,339
any other questions up the back

00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:17,239
just on TV I've sort of thought about

00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,220
doing my toes in with that just as an

00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:22,970
easy way into the out world for me sort

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,669
of console Python programmer is it

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:29,559
possible to make really sexy high

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:34,759
quality apps that you'd sort of release

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:36,679
yeah do you have Windows no there's

00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,369
really not easy on Windows it's really

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,399
easy if you've got terminal so apple

00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:46,009
Linux is fine and all the instructions

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,470
are on the on the website as to how to

00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:52,399
package it up you can do both iOS and

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,349
apk you can there's some really cool

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,840
animation stuff there's some stuff built

00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:59,570
in but you can even change the libraries

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,619
of buttons and stuff it's just beyond my

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,169
year 11 and 12

00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:04,940
of course so it's it's feasible to say

00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,129
this is the platform I'm using for my

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,159
graphical apps and kind of learn that

00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:12,489
one if you're gonna learn one I think so

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,970
I really like that it allows you to go

00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:18,759
iOS or Android yeah there's some really

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:24,109
cool stuff in there that talks to the

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:33,049
sensors in your phone yeah as I said

00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:38,179
it's just beyond us cool thank you this

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:40,549
will be the last question with regards

00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:42,919
to the first problem that you had how

00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:45,220
easy is it to debug issues that you're

00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,830
having like that okay

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,769
four years ago I would I was less

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,330
excited about the deeper it seemed

00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:54,349
because it went through the Python

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,009
engine

00:28:54,349 --> 00:29:01,190
I'm sorry PI game it's I don't know it

00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:02,570
had this every third era was exactly the

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,539
same it was something about an umbrella

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,940
and nobody could tell what it meant and

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,499
even the web-like had was no help

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,200
they're like yeah it's just bad

00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:14,570
debugging but now we're finding that

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,089
it's identifying lines it's it's telling

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,879
you exactly where things are a problem

00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,460
it still doesn't like tabbing issues in

00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:24,130
the kv file and call

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:29,710
issues but apart from that you pretty

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:32,610
well know what your problem is yeah cool

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:36,210
thank you very much Amanda we have the

00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,210
