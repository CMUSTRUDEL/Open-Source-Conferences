Drupal and Django have much in common. They’re both open source tools for building the web. They’re also marked by some fundamental differences. However, both are so much more than that.

"Every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret!" - Charles Dickens.

Let’s explore the darkly clustered houses of these two different communities of open source people. 

 - What common challenges do we face?
 - What different approaches do we take?
 - What can we learn from each other?

And finally, what could we do together?

okay so contrary to Russell's

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,929
introduction I'm not here to tell you

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,840
why Django sucks i'm also not here to

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:23,570
tell you why Drupal is awesome although

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,640
it is I'm here to take you sightseeing

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:31,170
into two different cities in the world

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,390
of the open web I'm Donna Benjamin I sit

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,700
on the board of the drupal association I

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,910
used to chair the community working

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,850
group of the Drupal community and I know

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,890
I'm on the board of open asokan

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,789
Australia Foundation and I recently

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,559
joined catalyst IT here in Melbourne but

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,210
this is not about me so I don't want to

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,370
go into any more detail on any of that

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,530
the only important thing is I'm Khattak

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,329
rub on the twitters and if you want to

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,789
talk to me talk to me on the twitters

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,690
I'd be here I want to hear your comments

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,000
your disagreements I want you to amplify

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:12,920
stuff you like I really want to continue

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,619
this conversation so London and Paris a

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,299
tale of two cities is a classic novel

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:26,130
written by Charles Dickens who here has

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:29,990
read it turns up a few of you who here

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,390
has perhaps seen a movie adaptation

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,490
hardly anyone I've got a confession to

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,689
make I've done neither I just really

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,100
like the title a tale of two cities

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,479
compares london and paris in

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,799
revolutionary and post-revolutionary at

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:53,100
france this is the terribly famous

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,560
opening line for the book it was the

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,130
best of times it was the worst of times

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:05,670
it was the age of wisdom it was the age

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:08,450
of foolishness dualities this talk has

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,909
nothing to do with this book

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,849
are you relieved some of you are yet

00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:17,310
good okay so except for one pet and 11

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,110
key fact and that is it has a point of

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,879
comparison Django and Drupal are both

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,890
projects in the midst of a different

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:31,739
kind of revolution every one of those

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,970
darkly clustered houses encloses its own

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:40,430
secret is it weird to think of Django

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,079
and Drupal ER CDs in a way they are

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:47,370
their cities in a world of open source

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:52,560
software they're made of people when we

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:56,250
enter a new city we have the opportunity

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,190
to make discoveries every house has its

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,200
secret but there are no secrets to the

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,239
inhabitants of those houses we know

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,769
what's going on in our houses but people

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,409
outside have no idea so I want to take

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,829
you on a bit of a subterranean tour of

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:18,870
the Drupal community I want to show you

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,730
a little bit about us and I want you to

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,790
draw your own comparisons with the

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,069
Django community because I can't I've

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,459
only just met you I was only just

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,440
invited to come hang out so I leave it

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,650
as an exercise for the audience to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:41,720
consider how you compare to what I'm

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:46,139
going to show you about Drupal so I

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,629
first met Django about a decade ago to

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,660
this day this is one of the most awesome

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,480
conference talks I ever saw I think it

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,040
may have even been a lightning talk is

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,930
that either of these people in the room

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,299
Ellen Greene and Ben Askins know so what

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,389
they did was they were evaluating a

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,370
framework for creating websites and I

00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,720
think they workmen avian buddies or they

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,549
were in the same team or something and

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,379
one was like a Python developer and the

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,150
other was a ruby developer and they

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,400
wanted to kind of check it out so they

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,630
put together a spec for a product that

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,880
they wanted to build and they went ahead

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,139
and they kind of built it but in their

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,499
lightning talk they did

00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,449
side by side within five minutes and it

00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,830
was awesome was like neck-and-neck was

00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,779
it Django gonna win or was Ruby gonna

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,279
win and you know there were strengths

00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,169
and weaknesses and it was just it just

00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,449
brought the whole kind of debate to

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,889
light what's really awesome is they are

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,289
they wrote a paper and they actually

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,849
kind of showed their you know the

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,949
research that they had done and where

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:46,499
the points of comparison were and where

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,569
Django was better than Ruby where Ruby

00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:51,120
was better than with in Django it was

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,099
really really cool unfortunately there

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,110
doesn't seem to be video or slides or

00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,729
anything so I've probably built up this

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,009
great memory of this thing and which is

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,810
probably completely fault but you know

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,259
it was in my mind so that's when I first

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,150
Django when I first Jengo video when I

00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,340
first met Django it's kind of scary that

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:13,460
that's a decade ago so I have been aware

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,870
of you guys this one's less awesome

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,689
those of you who know me know that I'm a

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,789
massive inkscape fan it's a great open

00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,139
source project it's just awesome they

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,759
made a decision a few years ago to

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:30,659
rebuild their website using Django CMS

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,089
awesome not so much this has been a

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:35,310
cause of confusion and frustration for

00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,319
me I'm you know I come as a professional

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,339
content management kind of person I just

00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,379
like went how does this thing even work

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,789
to be fair probably me and you know the

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,949
middle I kind of googled around I

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,990
generally found my way through but it

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:55,800
really it was just really puzzling to me

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:57,750
I wanted them to use Drupal but and this

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,199
is another thing I know about the Django

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,830
community you have a really strong code

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,310
of conduct even better than that there's

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,870
a guide on how to uphold the code of

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:16,229
conduct and you go one step further

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,909
publicly making available information on

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,550
the number of incidents that have been

00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:28,760
reported and handled this is outstanding

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:31,790
it really is so thank you

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,500
and thank you for another reason when I

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,940
was on the Drupal community working

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,170
group we borrowed from Django's

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,250
enforcement manual I'm not so keen on

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:45,440
the name but but we borrowed from that

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:55,130
document when creating our own policy

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:58,340
for for handling conflict and whilst we

00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,870
can never share code because we're built

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,320
in different languages we speak

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,010
different languages PHP and Python we

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,990
can share process we can share how we do

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,270
community or we can learn from each

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,660
other in very real and practical ways

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,030
and I think this is an example of that

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,870
so I'm really grateful for the work this

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:24,980
community has done in this space and

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:33,490
impressed so kudos give yourselves a

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:36,290
round of applause well done sorry okay

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,800
it's been said that Django is a

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,380
framework with CMS like tendencies by

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,600
someone along mas and the Drupal is a

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,730
CMS with framework like tendencies what

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,240
does that mean what does that really

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,610
mean hold that thought tell me later

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,560
tweeted at me I'd really like to kind of

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,780
unpack that a bit and I'm not going to

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,660
do it now but what I think it means is

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,650
that we actually have a huge amount in

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,790
common we're trying to solve the same

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,530
kinds of problems right yes we're trying

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,280
to build websites of one kind or another

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,900
we kind of as a cna a Drupal as a CMS

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,910
with framework like tendencies sort of

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,220
gets into the web application space and

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,450
sometimes Django gets asked to do boring

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:29,600
content management yeah so we have a lot

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,870
in common we actually have some of the

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,820
same end users like the people who visit

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,979
a Drupal site or a django site have no

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,830
idea it's been built with Drupal or

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,630
Django the people who are putting

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,230
content on those sites probably didn't

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,550
get to choose

00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,400
use whether it was going to be Drupal or

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:50,270
Django they're kind of victims of it in

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,980
a way as i was with the inkscape site so

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,840
we have a lot more in common than we

00:08:51,980 --> 00:09:00,590
might think so here's a puzzle for you

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:03,050
what six letter word beginning with D is

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:09,470
the name of a popular web development

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:13,910
tool guesses is it three down or six

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,830
across it's both right it's a really

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,020
silly thing to sort of highlight how

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,090
much we have in common but it's kind of

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,490
you know it's there it's a trivial thing

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:27,380
but you know tricky for our crossword

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:30,700
puzzle designers Oh points later for

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,930
anyone who can guess what one across is

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,360
one of the other things we have in

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,540
common is the Django Software Foundation

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,040
and the drupal association up both us

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,880
nonprofits they share the same legal

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,210
structure they're both the 501 3c threes

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,750
and this means are their educational it

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,100
also means that they are that they can

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,880
receive donations which are tax

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,490
deductible if you're a United States

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,340
taxpayer not so much for us but we'll

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,740
leave that alone but there there are

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,940
other nonprofit structures in the US and

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,880
some of them are more like trade

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,520
associations but this one that we use

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,310
both Django and Drupal is much more

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,470
about a public good and providing a

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,870
public benefit and I think that's

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,400
interesting commonality we have as well

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,370
this one's obvious right was this a

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,620
surprise to anybody they're both open

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,780
source but this is where they're

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,850
different different licenses I'm not

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,410
going to get into the deep dirty

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,330
differences of bsd versus GPL but it is

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,190
a difference and it has an impact on the

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:49,970
culture and the ecosystem around the

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:52,070
project so on to those differences this

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,430
is a great quote Fiat hofstetter is a

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,030
Dutch sociologist culture is to a

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,170
collective

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,340
of what personality is to the individual

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,110
so I sort of thought when I was

00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,140
preparing this talk that I would go and

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,040
see what i could find out about Django's

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:13,960
culture and i found i think it was in

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,850
the django book in chapter one this line

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,680
how Django's origins have shaped the

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,470
culture of it's open source community

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,580
haha I thought I found it didn't

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,530
actually turn out to be that

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:30,740
illuminating but what did follow was

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:32,870
this we welcome you we work with the

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,520
Django web framework and we invite

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:41,360
everyone to contribute to the core

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,180
Django code to the ecosystem of Django

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,300
packages and the community come build

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:51,890
the web with us that's pretty cool

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,600
that's pretty open that's pretty

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,430
inviting do you stand by that do you

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,670
find that's a good indication of the

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:07,610
culture of your community are you all

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:11,210
asleep give me some nods or shakes yes

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,880
great good on you being welcoming is not

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,370
actually all that common in our open

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,520
source world so clearly Django is a

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:23,770
great city for visitors to visit for

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:27,650
tourists to sightsee good on you so I

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:32,090
want to plant a seed in your thoughts I

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:36,740
want to ask you this question how would

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:40,730
you describe the Django community okay I

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:45,370
want you to think about this hold the

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,370
thought write it down tweeted

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,920
wake back up I want you to really sort

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,540
of think about actually stopped thinking

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,360
about it now let it marinate in the back

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,030
of your minds and tell me later I really

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
kind of want to know how would you

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:08,270
describe the drupal sorry the Django

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,270
community this is some pictures of the

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:14,210
Drupal community out to play at events

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,040
like this one these are various Drupal

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,280
events around the world various points

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,680
in time that one down there is Drupal

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,520
South Drupal south in Melbourne a few

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,280
years ago up in the top that's true for

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,900
women that's one of the big conferences

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,160
in the US the one in the middle is

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:37,730
Sydney drupalcon we're big there's a lot

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,080
of us and we are everywhere absolutely

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:46,090
all over the planet except in Antarctica

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,800
all right sorry what that is awesome

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,210
that is so awesome congratulations I'm

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,000
very pleased to hear that Django is in

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,920
Antarctica and it's so cool so this is a

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,670
kind of global map every pin here

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,370
represents a party that was head late

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:05,090
last year to celebrate the release of

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,160
Drupal 8 it was fantastic I was very

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,980
pleased to see that Hobart made it onto

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,580
the list is the most southerly to beat

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,130
Reykjavik as the most northerly cool of

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,170
course we celebrate with cake but the

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,460
Drupal further doesn't end there we we

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:25,640
also for some reason have Drupal soup

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,390
always puzzled me and drupal bacon which

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,750
is a bit weird

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:34,500
Oh Fletcher boat some people are really

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,330
committed Drupal tattoos and this is not

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,480
the only one by any stretch of the

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,720
imagination Drupal is filled with people

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,440
who are passionate about Drupal and we

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,410
say come for the code and stay for the

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,910
community and it's really true some

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,140
people matter on them under their breath

00:14:50,910 --> 00:15:01,110
because you wouldn't stay for the code

00:14:52,140 --> 00:15:04,490
ah I won't comment um but they do stay

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,790
for the community and sometimes that's

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:12,000
causes its own challenges there's even

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:17,610
Drupal babies because you know community

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,820
brings people together art so community

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,620
is really at the heart of this we talked

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,190
an awful lot about community where we

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,150
talked about open source an awful lot

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:35,870
right but what is it what do we actually

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:38,070
mean by community again another question

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,960
ponder it I'd really like to hear some

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,040
thoughts about what we mean by community

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:50,130
I suggest that to have a real a better

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:52,380
understanding that we we look back let's

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,760
be honest here humans have been doing

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,320
community for a lot longer than they've

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,240
been doing the technologies that we take

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,980
a granted we've been gathering in groups

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,740
and sharing knowledge and all of that

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,400
kind of stuff for you know millennia as

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:09,300
opposed two decades there's much we can

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:13,080
learn from old ancient communities this

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,970
picture is of a stone house so you're

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,870
probably familiar with round houses in

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,070
prehistoric you know presto a qk you're

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,460
probably less familiar with the fact

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,890
that this is here in victoria this stone

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,200
house the foundations of this stone

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,040
house or at least seventeen hundred

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:35,040
years old and it's part of a group of

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,570
houses which represents the fact that

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,200
there was a community that lived in them

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,310
and a whole ecosystem of eel traps

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,170
nearby where

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,730
industry you know there was an industry

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,830
of trading but eels around the country

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,140
we can learn a lot from communities

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:56,400
outside the tech world but we don't

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,310
often do that who here is familiar with

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,480
the call her information management

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,270
system will library management system

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,730
yeah and the leader of the call help

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,310
project is Chris Cormac and he gave a

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,800
really beautiful talk at Linux confer

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:14,280
you this year about what he's learned

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,670
from his Maori heritage and applied he

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,750
his Drupal in his kohar community it was

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,480
really touching and there were some

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,980
fantastic lines in it and phrases but

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,170
there in Maori and I can't pronounce

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,590
them so go watch the talk really

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,750
worthwhile I've been saying for a while

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,240
that I think the open source should try

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:39,990
to solve some of its community

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:41,040
challenges by turning outwards at Drupal

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,480
cons we've been running community

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,850
summits for a while and I facilitated

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,130
the last couple of them and been

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,380
involved in sort of iterations that

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,480
existed before that I also run the

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,280
community leadership summit at lenox

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,350
comfy you for the past couple of years

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,190
I'm handing the baton over this year

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,450
which I'm quite relieved about anyway

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,740
these are really great opportunities for

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,650
the community to come together and talk

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,720
about the stuff that matters the stuff

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,190
that's difficult the stuff that's

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,350
awesome and the stuff where they want

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:17,100
help not with code but with community so

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,630
I went looking in the Django community

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,610
to see if you had something like this

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,030
and I couldn't really find anything

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:27,780
directly equivalent but I did find a lot

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,700
about Django girls and this program of

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,500
encouraging women to come into the

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,110
durango community to learn to code and

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,179
to become part of things and as part of

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,880
that there's the jungle girls summit

00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,800
which brings the organizers together to

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,600
make those events even better to share

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,700
what they know so these are really good

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,690
examples of dealing with some of these

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,720
challenges lack of diversity is a

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:55,700
problem in the tech world if you don't

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,890
agree with me stand up and look around

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,230
and I'm talking about diversity in a

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,420
very broad sense not just gender which

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:10,200
is an obvious one but also age also

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:14,160
color also language also perspective

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,780
roles who here is a user of a django

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:23,630
website as opposed to a developer just

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:26,130
using django who are you also developers

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:31,460
who here is not a developer but just

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,460
uses a django website can you stand up

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,510
you are awesome you are absolutely

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,790
awesome thank you for being here thank

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,500
you for being part of this community I

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,510
wish there were a whole lot more of you

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,430
in this room and this is something I

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,010
think both Django and Drupal could learn

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:53,010
from wordpress wordpress events are

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,530
almost 5050 developers and users of

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,960
wordpress I've had some really nasty

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:04,820
things said by developers about those

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:08,130
users though they're just bloggers yeah

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,960
yeah let's move on oh here's a nice

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:15,510
topic so um I think this is something

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,310
all open source communities struggle

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:24,390
with burnout we are driven by passion we

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:26,970
are driven by pure kind of blood sweat

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,280
and tears in many ways and it takes a

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,900
huge amount of energy and we have people

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,610
come into our communities brimming with

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:38,490
enthusiasm ready to give to us ready to

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,370
help us ready to make a difference and

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,430
we got great do all this stuff do this

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,620
do that be this do that and they do it

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,990
and then perhaps we don't give them

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,820
enough acknowledgement perhaps they

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,750
don't get out of that what they thought

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,220
they would perhaps they just get tired

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,280
perhaps they just get sick of dealing

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,400
with the challenges and then they step

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,580
out and step away and we lose what they

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,310
brought in some ways they leave a legacy

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,410
sure but what are we also losing to

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:14,160
their knowledge in their perspective we

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,530
need to manage this better this is not 1

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,850
i've got a solution for you drupal

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,400
suffers from this just as much as

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,790
younger does some people say you can't

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,040
no one can handle to call releases of

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:30,210
Drupal it's too real too too brutal

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,680
which brings me to the tragedy of the

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,470
Commons who's familiar with this as an

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,170
economic theory yeah who thinks that we

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,730
suffer terribly from this factor who

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:43,710
thinks we actually no we don't we've

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,990
beat it what we have and we do every day

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,930
the open source communities around the

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,220
world the city is if you like are

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,780
beating the tragedy of the Commons just

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,400
through the fact that they exist and

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,250
they're successful the problems that

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,770
we're dealing with we deal with they

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,580
come up we work on them we're problem

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:07,950
solvers and we also have this amazing

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:10,730
human superpower communication because

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,920
we talk to each other because we say hey

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,780
we're actually kind of running the grass

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,700
down to low over here I think we better

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,670
leave ease up but let that field go

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,730
fallow right we actually talked to each

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,080
other we adjust we adapt so I think that

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,930
we've beat the tragedy of the Commons

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:35,520
and as Django devs I'm assuming I'm

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:37,170
sorry mostly Django devs actually are

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,490
you just give me a show of hands are you

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:44,520
a django dev oh they're most mostly i

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,950
think is accurate as django dads who've

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,410
come to a django event you are uniquely

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,980
placed to fight the tragedy of the

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,000
Commons you're here you're participating

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,800
you're sharing your knowledge your

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,090
learning stuff you may not be giving a

00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,760
talk but you're going to go back to your

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,050
to your places of work or your projects

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,200
and bring back what you've learned and

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,960
you will have benefited from the broader

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,910
knowledge of the community right how

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,020
many of you actually contribute directly

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:15,020
to the Django project stand up

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:32,960
thank you awesome awesome work so not

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:37,010
everyone can do that not everyone can

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,500
participate directly in that way but

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,330
many hands make light work small

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,950
contributions helped bug reports who's

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,530
made a bug report to the jungle project

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,360
a lot more of you so you are

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:53,030
participants give yourselves another

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,620
round of a course as developers we all

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,840
know the value of a really well-crafted

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,250
bug report right we know that it needs

00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,420
to have details in it that it should be

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,740
rep you know we should be able to

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,320
replicate and all that kind of stuff a

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,740
good bug report is a really useful thing

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,620
for a community to have so you're all

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,100
participating but there are lots of

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,110
other ways and I've talked about code

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,090
and submitting bug reports but there's

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,060
also documentation who's contributed to

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,770
the documentation some of you awesome

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:26,540
who's helped run events awesome huge

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,170
well actually let me pause to say a huge

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,920
thanks to Russell for putting on today

00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:35,930
and to the pike on organizers generally

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,760
I have run a few events so I don't know

00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,770
what's involved so that's also

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,260
contributing so any of this effort this

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:46,130
energy right when I say III is another

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:51,850
element energy we bring energy we bring

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:55,540
enthusiasm we bring evangelism this is

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,610
emotional labor this is also

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,710
contribution so if you as here as devs

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:07,820
who may not be contributing to code are

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:10,970
you evangelists for Jengo hmm more

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,780
coffee hallelujah are you evangelists

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,190
for Django

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,020
yes sir okay so in terms of the things

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:22,980
that you might want to yeah we'll talk

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:26,670
about that emotional labor is critical

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,310
crucial crack for successful open source

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,340
communities without enthusiasm without

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:35,130
energy passion evangelism you are

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:40,110
nothing but we don't value the people

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:43,080
who do this work think about that so

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,960
maybe you don't have time to give maybe

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,690
you don't have energy enthusiasm or e to

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,530
the power of three to give but if you're

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:56,700
a professional Django developer I'm

00:25:51,530 --> 00:26:00,360
hoping you've got money how just think

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,430
about this could you afford to donate to

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,340
the Django Software Foundation the value

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:10,020
of one hour's work a month maybe not

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,170
maybe a percentage of that but if you're

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:16,050
earning real cash doing real work with

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,820
Django and you don't have time to do the

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:20,490
other stuff you can make a huge

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,850
contribution in this very very simple

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,340
way go to the Django project com /

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:30,590
fundraising page without your handy

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,590
credit card and pay some goddamn dollars

00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:41,550
and if you can't because you can't

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,910
afford to then fine but maybe you can

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:48,680
afford an hour a month to help out in

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,000
one of those other ways yeah

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,460
contribution comes in all sorts of

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,370
shapes and sizes and it is the only way

00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,750
we beat the tragedy of the Commons so

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:05,130
speaking of beating things let's get

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,740
back to that revolution what can we do

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:11,370
together we can't share code we can

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:16,730
share ideas how do we beat back the

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:20,580
forces of darkness what do I mean

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,620
whether the open web I'm not speaking

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,500
elvish

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,430
that's a word with a Russell and I were

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,630
discussing it earlier the open web this

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,670
thing that's been around for a long time

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,830
that we work in every day that we

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,840
probably almost don't think about

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:41,010
anymore like we don't think about oxygen

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:45,930
but we breathe it every minute the open

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:48,900
web Facebook Google Apple linkedin now

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:52,380
owned by microsoft they're slowly eating

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:55,080
the internet they're pushing out the

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,030
independent open web the thing that we

00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,950
build every day right the stuff that we

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,780
do is becoming increasingly irrelevant

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,790
because people are in facebook they're

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,520
sharing stuff and Facebook public news

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,020
is even not you know it's being kind of

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,790
gone to wreck to Facebook and things

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,050
like medium and people are blogging on

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:15,450
linkedin whether the open web of course

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,040
these are not the only ones apps like

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,270
the walled gardens of apps that we're

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,700
doing stuff in apps rather than

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,570
necessarily on the web you know there's

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,679
a lot of factors in play at the moment

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,760
one thing though it is important to note

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,620
that all of these players are

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,710
contributing to open source they really

00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,240
are upstream they're they're

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,980
contributing to upstream projects they

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,980
use their also releasing internal

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,500
projects I mean Facebook did hip hop vm

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,020
which has huge to the PHP community lots

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,090
of learning there that then went into HP

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,030
seven so there's not it's not all bad

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,910
they do great work so I'm not dissing

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,520
them but I'm just saying hey we need to

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,450
be aware of what's changing we need to

00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,120
fight for what we believe is important

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,980
the real risk to us as developers open

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,500
web sites is that a technologies just

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,170
kind of become irrelevant and what are

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,080
we without our technologies we're still

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,080
communities right we need to level up

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:22,740
we're losing because we suck we're not

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:26,990
putting people first the big players are

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:29,730
investing hugely in user experience in

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:34,440
meeting the needs of their users in

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:36,269
understanding who their users are how

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,649
have we become the weakest link

00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:42,779
Zach Rosen runs on Pantheon which is a

00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:46,109
hosting kind of company for mostly

00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:49,649
WordPress and Drupal this was part of a

00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:52,259
conversation between him and dress boat

00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:55,729
art the founder of Drupal and matt

00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:58,229
mullenweg the founder of WordPress and

00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:59,639
he sort of threw this into the mix

00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,649
there's a kind of series of blog posts

00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:04,889
that goes around here but I think it's

00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:07,469
important the people who use our

00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:09,779
websites what do they want I don't want

00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:11,989
us to call them users I want us to call

00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,759
them people their citizens in our cities

00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:16,739
more questions keep thinking about the

00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:20,639
answers I don't have them I'd be really

00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:23,940
keen to heal thoughts I stole this slide

00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:26,639
from a talk dress gave at South by

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,379
Southwest earlier this year drupal wants

00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:29,940
to build bridges across technologies

00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:33,659
we're not just saying that we're doing

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,309
it drupal 7 wearisome to the house we

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,399
put the symphony framework in instead of

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:40,469
having all our weird drupal isms we

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,479
brought ckeditor in instead of you know

00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:44,519
saying Oh everybody wants to choose

00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:45,749
their own WYSIWYG actually no one wants

00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,649
to choose it they just want it to be

00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:51,450
there as a result of our participation

00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:54,269
in both of those projects both of those

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,849
projects have also got stronger we have

00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,440
participated upstream they have seen

00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:59,969
that the problems we're trying to solve

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,829
are the same problems they're trying to

00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:05,700
assault and by working together we've

00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:10,969
made all of those projects better so can

00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:13,469
we collaborate with Django not on code

00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:16,049
hopefully I've said there's lots more

00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:19,019
than code though the fact that we have

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,129
events like the open source developers

00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,809
conference where there is cross

00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:25,259
pollination is great I'd like to see a

00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:27,029
lot more of that but drew says you know

00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,769
we can collaborate with different

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:30,209
thinkers different leaders we can learn

00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:32,219
from each other and even where we're

00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:35,459
different points of comparison are

00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:41,719
really useful and ultimately I hope that

00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:45,329
together we can champion the open web so

00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:49,790
I'd like to close by recommending three

00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:52,530
books who's heard of Kathy Sierra

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:55,740
whoa okay you all have to go and buy

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:58,710
this book immediately Kathy Sierra is

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,780
also she's been doing lots of stuff

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,850
about user experience for years she was

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,800
on made a Java developer her involved in

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:07,950
the big java event some time ago and

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,240
she's recently released this book badass

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:14,010
making users awesome no one cares about

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,380
the tool that they're really using what

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,720
they care about is the task and what

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,790
Drupal and Django have in common is this

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,190
broader context which Kathy talks about

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,380
we're making websites people were doing

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,040
the same thing are we solving the

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,130
problem in fundamentally different ways

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,300
right there's so much we have in common

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,460
then there's the art of community john o

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,990
bacon who founded the community

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,240
leadership summits that run in portland

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,790
every year and he spun off the community

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,990
leadership summit X it like Ted and TEDx

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:48,030
bit dagi but anyway so he's got some

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,040
really great insights on how we actually

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,870
understand what our communities do and

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,940
how we participate in them more

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:58,050
effectively and ultimately this book I

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:02,160
know some of you have read it and I'll

00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:04,530
probably read it too now after this yes

00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,780
but we haven't had a revolution in

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,670
Australia right the closest we got was

00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,260
the Eureka Stockade there's also the

00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:14,010
wars we kind of don't talk about the

00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,930
frontier Wars so you know so we can we

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,600
say these things but thankfully the

00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:21,180
fight for the open web is a different

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,820
kind of revolution it's more of a

00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:29,580
turning of the wheel than a bloody

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:35,280
battle right so our strong healthy

00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:39,750
vibrant diverse communities are a huge

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,790
huge strength right we might not have as

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,490
much as much diversity in the room today

00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,590
as that as really truly represents the

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:50,490
global Django community I mean I've seen

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:52,590
pictures you also are global you also

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,370
are all over the world and have people

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,600
of all shapes sizes colors and creeds

00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,210
this is something that's beautiful about

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,490
open source we actually put politics and

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,710
religion and a bunch of other stuff that

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,000
divides people

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,760
outside the room we still have that as

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,890
part of our individual personalities but

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,690
we don't let it stop us from working

00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:17,010
together and that's kind of awesome

00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:20,820
don't you think no just me I know you're

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,340
nodding I had good good good good so we

00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,220
need to ensure we're creating

00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,950
opportunities for our members the

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:33,900
members of our communities to experience

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:35,490
purpose autonomy and mastery I stole

00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,190
those from I think Daniel pink but

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,370
they're at the K of motivation if we can

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,870
make sure that our community is offering

00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:46,020
the opportunity for people to be

00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:49,800
autonomous to make decisions to master

00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,750
their tools and to have purpose to

00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,140
contribute to something greater than

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,140
themselves then we'll be unbeatable I

00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:06,380
think we need to think more about people

00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:09,270
the people we're building the web for

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:14,760
not just us we need to be thinking about

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:27,480
them all of them everywhere thank you

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:29,160
thank you very much Donna we do have

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,720
time for a few questions so if anyone

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,010
would like to ask Donna a question

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,510
please remember of course that a

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:39,150
question should be asked in the form of

00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:41,010
a question starts with how why not I or

00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,440
my as work your way up to the microphone

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:48,330
just to get the the conversation started

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,460
though you mentioned the the the word

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,110
price is very good at engaging community

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,790
so engaging their their their non

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,760
developer communities one of the

00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:59,490
interesting problems differences there

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,670
is that there is a world in which you do

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,980
just use WordPress versus the Django

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,550
world where in order to use Django you

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,320
kind of have to be developing Django and

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,480
there isn't that sort of analog of like

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,550
if a site is built in Django you have to

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,550
you don't care that it's built in Django

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,170
it says there so how I mean I drew pies

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,750
essentially the same sort of problem how

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,360
do we engage users when there isn't an

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:28,520
obvious analog like that so really you

00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,520
all build sites that no one ever uses

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,300
really is that a thing do we build

00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,830
websites that no one ever visits or sees

00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:46,290
or participated I don't yes yes an

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,420
example oh we need it for the mic

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,160
because it's been recorded so yeah all

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,470
right so I'll feel while you come up and

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,870
say because I think you're going to make

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,340
a very very good point but the point I'm

00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,950
trying to make is that we think about

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,680
you when we being kind we call them end

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:05,480
users you know what other profession

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,480
talks about its customers as users

00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:13,520
sorry am I alone sure sorry I think what

00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,500
he was trying to suggest is when you

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,349
when you're a user of a wordpress site

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,630
you go into the WordPress administration

00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:22,579
site you use WordPress you're very much

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,140
using it I think one of the big

00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,770
differences with Django that a lot of

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:31,880
people might know yeah no no it was an

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:34,700
answer that's an answer the the earth

00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,530
the administration part of Django is an

00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,200
optional adding right you might not know

00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:42,020
that you're using Django like you'll be

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,119
an avid user so in that sense how do we

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,160
how do we communicate with a group of

00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,770
people who may not even know they're

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,300
using the same framework in the sense

00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,060
that they're coming to different forms

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,710
different models different ideas they're

00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,930
not they're not using the same thing how

00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,730
do we engage with that absolutely fair

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,430
points or should we engage or should we

00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:05,900
absolutely fair point and I was being a

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:07,609
little bit cheeky I know look it's true

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,890
i mean triple has the same thing most of

00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:12,710
the time we do not engage with our users

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,930
at all they generally do not come to our

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,730
conferences although we have a kind of

00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,310
layer in between called site builders

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,260
were special non-developers with special

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:25,000
privileges and anyway i won't i won't

00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:28,010
bore you with my theories on that so

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,950
it's a real challenge actually how can

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,079
we I'd like to know wordpress does have

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,119
some unique special privileges in that

00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,280
regard but I still think that they honor

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,380
and respect the people who who use their

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,440
sites in ways that jungle and Drupal

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,390
just don't so very fair point totally

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,040
agree I'm trying to be a little bit

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:51,530
radical and facetious thank you thank

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,880
you for the talk is really nice so my

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,380
question is about fundraising which you

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,780
covered towards the sort of middle of

00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,940
the end that as you mentioned we have

00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,500
fundraising program in Django wait wait

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,240
is everyone got you could probably

00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,329
donate on your fines if you haven't

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,609
already done so very good so efficient

00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,750
is about like how does Drupal tackle

00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:10,130
that same problem like what kind of

00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,050
programs do you have in place there like

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,829
is there a cash flow issue there is a

00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,300
big going well like what was that like

00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:19,550
so I'm on the Finance Committee of the

00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,660
drupal association and I don't want to

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,960
talk too much about cash

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,670
flow at the motel however um how do we

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,339
handle fundraising and this is a really

00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,400
interesting question so thank you we

00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:32,960
have a number of things in place the the

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,910
core of the cash for the drupal

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,760
association comes from drupalcon North

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,440
America it makes gob loads of money

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,030
because the American culture is all

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,170
about sponsorship as a way of

00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:46,670
contributing drupalcon in Europe is a

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,619
kind of a bit more in the break-even

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,140
stakes it's still you know profitable so

00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:54,619
it's not a complete waste of time okay

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,660
no it's um joking joking please don't

00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,180
take that seriously so drupalcon Europe

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,579
isn't doesn't generate positive cash

00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,530
flow for the organization it's an

00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:07,849
important part of our core mission so

00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:10,309
obviously we do it so there's that and

00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:12,950
what we realized some years ago was that

00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,740
wasn't a really really sustainable

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,990
footing to be on all the eggs in one

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,849
basket so we talked about here's some

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:25,520
economic speak diversifying our revenue

00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:27,410
and looking at margins so putting on

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,089
conferences is really expensive and the

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,180
actual profit margin you get is quite

00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:34,880
small we developed the supporting

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,190
partner program where we ask people who

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,170
are donating large gobs of cash to the

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,450
conference to say could you donate a

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:45,130
smaller amount to us directly maybe

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,849
please and they did they understood that

00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,220
supporting the drupal association

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:51,289
directly rather than buying coffee for

00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,970
everyone at the event was actually going

00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:56,109
to be more directly beneficial so that

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:58,789
was a big first step in our growth and

00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:59,990
then and sorts of lots of other kinds of

00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,279
little programs around the side but

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,779
that's the big one and then we also

00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:05,240
started reaching out to technology

00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:07,069
partners so people who you know bolt on

00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,140
to Drupal in various ways you might

00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:10,819
integrate with Drupal and some of them

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,380
started to give us money as well so

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:14,900
that's really powerful the thing is

00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,789
we're kind of we used to have plumbing

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,440
and as part of our model but we don't

00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:19,880
anymore but we're kind of infrastructure

00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,400
really Django and Drupal right we're not

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,200
really shiny cool without their tools

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,359
anymore we kind of going to keep the

00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,099
lights on so supporting that work is

00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,289
important and then finally something we

00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,559
tried for the first time last year was

00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:34,440
the Drupal 8 accelerate program and this

00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,170
is where

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,180
we actively went out as the board and

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:44,640
did fundraising I thought it would be

00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:46,609
hilarious to run a chuck raffle no one

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,280
else really thought it was hilarious

00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:54,660
Thank You Katie the Americans were like

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,970
what's a chalk what are you talking

00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,839
about Donna what are you talking about I

00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:02,160
don't get it so um but but you know we

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,300
raised a quarter of a million dollars

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,190
Wow it wasn't it took raffle I wish but

00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,170
I did my bit as I took raffle anyone who

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:14,180
donated to my part of the campaign they

00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:18,270
got a digital chuck and that was awesome

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:21,390
say it digital chicken isn't it

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:22,710
hilarious okay it's just me alone so

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,450
anyway yes so there's a lot of stuff you

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,040
can do and it's an area where you can

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,420
see creatively often we kind of think

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,430
about the money side is dirty but

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,630
fundamentally it's one of the key ways

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,339
we're going to beat the tragedy of the

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,500
Commons if we can actually raise enough

00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:36,480
money to perhaps fund full time work on

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,550
our projects we're going to really nail

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,119
that problem yeah thank you guys janicki

00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,710
thank you all right uh-huh if there are

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,750
any other questions one probably this

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,310
one last one just around this out I know

00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,460
I did kind of vaguely invite you on

00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,170
stage to rip john you a new one sorry i

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,800
won't know you didn't and thank you very

00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:59,250
much for being kind one thing I would

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,780
sort of just a sort of note is Drupal

00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,910
seems to enlist at least to my

00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,190
perception seems to have a lot momentum

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,690
in some communities a government work

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,329
for example seems to be one area where

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,890
it's very very successful do you think

00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:12,180
there is anything the Django community

00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:16,140
can learn from the Drupal community

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,359
about being popular in certain circles

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,430
or communicating that narrative of why

00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:23,970
you're good in a certain space yeah

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,980
thing like that III ii to the power of

00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,349
sri that enthusiasm energy and

00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,819
evangelism is one of the key success

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:35,339
factors k sf's of drupal one of the big

00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:37,609
kind of turning points in our in our

00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:41,099
kind of world was when the White House

00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:43,140
adopter Drupal it was back in 2009 but

00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,400
you can see white house adopts Drupal

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,740
and then you look at the trends it's

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,660
love

00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,910
insane sudden to taper off but we're

00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,460
still like you know we're taping off and

00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,570
and and Jen guy was going up and you

00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,310
know all that sort of stuff but we've

00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,829
still got thousands of people at our

00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,680
events so there's this order of

00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:03,270
magnitude that's different right and the

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,760
White House choosing was was one of them

00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:08,339
and I think it's actually started along

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,890
before that when some key people in the

00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:14,010
Drupal community decided to use Drupal

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,990
for change they got involved in a

00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,730
presidential campaign a failed

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,339
presidential campaign of like last

00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,230
decade but they learned a lot and they

00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:25,170
developed campaigning techniques and I

00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:27,270
think that that kind of you know sowed

00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,369
the seeds i guess for that kind of move

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,710
into government in particular because

00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:33,810
once the White House did everyone did

00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,700
curiously our friends over in New

00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,220
Zealand they were using triple for

00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,099
government like way before that such

00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,930
leaders such leaders good question okay

00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,609
well if there's no other questions I say

00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,619
thank you very much on behalf of Jango

00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:49,070
khan and everybody please thank you

00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,070
thanks

00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,290
