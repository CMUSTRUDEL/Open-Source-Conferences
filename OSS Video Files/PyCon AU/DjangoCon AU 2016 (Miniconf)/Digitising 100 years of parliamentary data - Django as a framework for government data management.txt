Historical information on Australian Parliaments has been available in the Parliamentary Library's flagship publication the Parliamentary Handbook - an extensive almanac with biographies, tables and records dating back to Australia's federation. This data is used as a way to track key social issues, such as length of service, gender representation in parliament and historical election information in an authoritative format.

To improve access to this information the library began development of a mobile app which evolved into a complete Django-based data management system for managing parliamentary biographies and service histories based on Popolo, a civic data framework for the management and dissemination of parliamentary information. Along with interactive biographies and records of ministries and parties, the system for the first time allows users to build custom tables from complex queries that are dynamically updated as new information is made available.

Coupled with this is the development of a biographical data management system that will ensure that records of new parliamentarians and future changes to existing parliamentarians are captured in a single system.

In this presentation, we cover the challenges and successes in digitising over 100 years parliamentary data, including migration, data cleansing and data trust issues. We also provide a technical breakdown of the chosen framework and infrastructure, and issues during development especially when dealing with imprecise or incomplete historical records. Lastly, we cover the Django apps for data modelling and querying built for this project that have already been released as open-source.

Samuel Spencer library innovation

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,880
manager Parliament parliamentary library

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:24,570
talking about digitizing democracy thank

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:26,640
you much Sam good morning oh cool

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,490
good morning my name is Samuel Spencer

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,980
and I am from the parliamentary library

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:36,630
that's my office and I work there it's

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,510
it's actually a really nice place it's

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,250
an amazing it's a it's an amazing place

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,480
to work actually and for those of you

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,000
who aren't aware the parliamentary

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,890
library provides impartial information

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,329
services to members and Senators

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,539
throughout the year no matter where they

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,180
are

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,210
so whenever a parliamentarian has a

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,820
question about digital rights management

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,930
windmills the census they ask us so they

00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,550
come to us and they get a lot of

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,170
information but one of the other things

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,460
that we do is every time there's a

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,769
change of Parliament which happened

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,260
recently we published the parliamentary

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,520
handbook and this is an ongoing omnibus

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,830
that's been published for the last

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,260
hundred years that details the

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,720
biographies the lives and and the

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,479
political statistics of Australia's

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,150
history it's an amazingly large rich

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,790
data set that's that's just insanely

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,530
cool it is it really is and I didn't

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,110
believe that until quite recently I'm a

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,430
programmer I'm not a historian but now

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,790
I'm a historian as well it's kind of

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,200
cool

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,240
it's kind of fascinating and when I

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,420
first started a year ago they said we

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,210
want to build an app like we want to

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,979
make a parliamentary history app I said

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,409
great where's the data they said there

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,450
oh okay well well that's not actually

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,430
true is it looks more like that which

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,040
wasn't much better but it was a start so

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,689
we had a whole bunch of Excel

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,630
spreadsheets which I don't know about

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,159
you I actually love Excel because people

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,630
get it people use it they can put

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,549
information in there and at least it's

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,409
structured like you can do stuff with

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,880
Excel and that's a big part of what I

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,890
want to talk to about talk to you about

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,099
today is like how the hell do you manage

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,720
this information and we started like I'm

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm a Python developer and I said well I

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,570
think I think we can

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,800
in Django and there was a lot of

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,650
convincing a lot of going back and forth

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,140
and we started having to kind of figure

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,120
out how do you how do you describe this

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,280
like nobody's ever sat down before and

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,070
said what is the ontology what is the

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,870
data model behind politics like we

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,790
couldn't actually find one the closest

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,980
we got was a standard called pop alone

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,480
and Popolo is quite big in the open

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,120
civic community in the open data

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
community where civic journalists and

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,170
and engaged citizens will try and

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,060
describe what they think was going on

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,010
inside of parliament it had never been

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,690
done the other way where we as an

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,570
official organization said this is what

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,340
we do this is how we do it and it's a

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,110
small data model that really looks at

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,370
people positions and memberships in

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,530
those positions and as soon as we

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,120
started to dig around the surface it

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,130
started to get a lot bigger so

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,200
organizations are parties their

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,900
political chambers their ministries

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
they're these really interesting things

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,260
posts like a position that somebody held

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,300
wasn't like they were elected to service

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,830
they they were in a ministry we have a

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,630
real issue with ministries like they're

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,970
about four different things so we have

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,500
very long names for them now and there

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,210
are appointments so you were the speaker

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,280
you are a representative you're a High

00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,590
Commissioner all these things and we

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,760
started to dig into it and we came to

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,220
the realization that it was actually

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,770
really difficult to manage and we went

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,720
through many many iterations of writing

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,640
models hi so this is one of the one of

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,860
the only forums where I can say we we

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,880
had to write models by about 20 times

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,400
and being a lazy developer we were asked

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,110
quite frequently to describe what what

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
our model was what our data model was

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,380
and and being the lazy developer right

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,810
that I am instead of spending five

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,880
minutes updating a Visio diagram I spent

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,150
about two weeks build building spaghetti

00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,870
and meatballs so has anybody here seen

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,390
spaghetti and meatballs oh wow that's so

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,500
rad this is like two weeks of work and

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,160
it was so cool

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,350
but it was so freaking amazing to do I

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,520
loved it it's so cool so if you've used

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,290
spaghetti and meatballs you know what it

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,850
is but for those of you who don't

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,260
Django is really great at building your

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,970
data bases it's great at building your

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,170
admin interfaces and I was like no I

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,090
needed to do a little bit more I

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,700
actually need it to describe - to build

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,050
the UML diagrams for me and I say UML

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,610
but I put it in brackets because I hate

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,319
UML and it's like you know

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,490
but it comes really close like it does a

00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,469
really good job of actually describing

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,879
and this was one of the big pieces that

00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,650
people love because they said what's in

00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,879
there and I'm like well this this is in

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,460
there and it meant we could start

00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,319
building everything from models pi we

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,340
said we've got the documentation we've

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,840
got the interfaces we've got the

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,939
databases we've got modeling diagrams

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,319
all from one place so nothing ever got

00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,180
out of sync as long as the code was

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,629
managed everything else was good to go

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,009
so just as a quick aside spaghetti and

00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,189
meatballs if you're a junior developer

00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,500
basically it takes all of the attributes

00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,960
from all of your Django models in in a

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,810
model stock pie it grabs all the help

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,479
text and it grabs all of the dock dock

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,240
strings for all of your objects throws

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,009
them into a nice HTML page that you can

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,860
expose through all of your regular

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,509
django ways you can add like protection

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,719
for it an authentication all that jazz

00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,789
so it's kind of RAD and we started to

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,560
build pages that look like this so

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:26,159
here's another question does anybody

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,389
know who Edmond Barton is great of those

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,879
people who had their hands up who

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,159
remembers the the big ad campaign around

00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,449
like 2001 they said we're a hundred

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,740
years old never buddy knows who's George

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,469
Washington is but nobody knows here

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,539
Edmund Barton is yeah yeah it's like

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,979
he's our first prime minister and he's

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,009
actually kind of cool like it's really

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,990
fascinating so he was in Parliament for

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,729
three years in federal parliament and he

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,680
was the first Prime Minister and I

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,750
started looking at going you don't just

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,460
get to be first Prime Minister like

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,409
there's a story there so he started

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,689
looking at managing state political

00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,029
services as well and he had 20 years of

00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,580
state service in in the New South Wales

00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,830
Senate sorry the New South Wales like

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,839
law house prior to Federation where he

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,360
he was he got a reputation with the

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:13,250
Australian bulletin magazine for showing

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,250
up as the Speaker of the House drunk

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,160
subsequently to be known in the press as

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,440
tosspot Toby

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,819
that's not that's that's actually true

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,509
that's a 100 century you can look it up

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,389
online

00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,340
tosspot toby and then after after

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,449
federation he was a prime minister he

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,750
didn't like it and then during the High

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,180
Court

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,800
so really fascinating individual and by

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,630
bringing this this rich data set

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,370
together by by actually describing it a

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,870
very very structured way we could start

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,639
exporting it and doing really cool

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,729
things with it which brings us to our

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,199
next slide is timelines aren't enough we

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,810
actually we actually get a lot of

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,330
information requests around things so we

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,759
got a request just after we started the

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,770
project around that the the political

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
spill last year I'm from Canberra so I

00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,710
follow a lot of politics and have a lot

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,930
of preconceptions about how much people

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,340
actually follow these things but there

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,630
was the spill between Tony Abbott and

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,849
Malcolm Turnbull and one of the

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,610
questions they asked was like ah this is

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,320
like a really young hip funky cabinet

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,360
like it's got to be it's the youngest

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,860
cabinet in all of history and they said

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,080
can we can we actually prove that and

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,220
and a couple of people oh no we'd have

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,289
to go through the books would be hard

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,639
we're not we're not sure and may in a

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:24,240
colleague of mine who worked on this

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,240
said give us a few minutes so building

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,340
with Django we you know did a whole

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,930
bunch of database queries and said you

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,669
know find me all the people in all of

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,139
the ministries subtracts their dates of

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,969
birth from the start of their ministry

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,430
add them all up someone from the verge

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,289
of a ministry and yes the answer is yes

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,210
it was on average about two years

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:44,159
younger than than Tony Abbott's ministry

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,409
but by no means the youngest and we had

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,150
the proof for that and we got the proof

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,789
we kind of turned that proof of concept

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,710
into this django data interrogator which

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,800
people will be less familiar with has

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,389
anybody seen this one no that's okay

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,699
this one is still kind of cool but it's

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,550
it's kind of dorky as well the Django

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,830
Data interrogator was a tool that I put

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,719
together where it provides a front-end

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,449
so that you can interrogate your django

00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,520
models through the front-end and it does

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,570
a lot of basically a lot of magic behind

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,340
all or not a lot of magic behind the

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,539
scenes we don't like that term but it

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,750
does a lot of work behind the scenes to

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,699
translate user strings into django

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,380
database query calls and hit the

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,120
database once to get a whole bunch of

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,740
information out so it goes it hits the

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,440
database it brings back tabular

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,589
information and and gives it to you and

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,940
then we went okay tables are cool but we

00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,800
want to do stuff with them

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,390
like people don't get tables they want

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,120
to see graphs and this is one of my

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,340
favorite ones this is also one of my

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,380
points of pride around this is this is

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,910
the graph of women in Parliament does

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,710
anybody know who strategies first

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:54,000
senator a female senator and member

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:55,470
where who and Enid line there

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,720
Dorothy tag me an end in line with the

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,280
first female member and Senator that's a

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,990
really nice political fact that comes up

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,820
at trivia night so remember that if you

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,860
don't remember anything else remember

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,770
that because it's kind of interesting

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,500
but what we didn't kind of realize what

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,860
nobody really picked up on was this so

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,870
you can see any line came in and then

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,560
dropped out and and we had two female

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,900
members and then no one for like 25

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,970
years they kind of had a couple of stop

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,150
starts and then in the 80s liked the

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,190
idea of women in the lower house caught

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,400
on and and they've stayed ever since but

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,180
since 1942 we've always had a female

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,170
senator um this one right here is is

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,060
really interesting so when you see a

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,980
blip going down that's where a whole

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,300
bunch of people lost their seat and a

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,820
whole bunch of people replace them so a

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,290
drop going down is basically a big old

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,860
change of government except for this one

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,110
here this little drop those those two

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,550
blips it had me doing my head and I

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,670
thought my code was broken for about a

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,620
week no that was actually a lady from

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,510
South Australia who decided she didn't

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,370
like actually getting elected she just

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,260
liked being in Parliament so very

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,150
frequently she would resign her seat

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,890
take a Casual Vacancy and come back in

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,750
and was actually not elected for nine

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:15,380
years she just kept getting reappointed

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,380
by the governor

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,500
it's kind of cool like that's that's the

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,960
thing that happened like you're like

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,840
you're going this who's like I presume

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,230
like probably 90% of Australia 90% of us

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,170
are Australians yeah like okay cool this

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,750
is your history like this happened to

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,580
our country and our political history as

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,990
the last speaker said we didn't have a

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,280
revolution we just had a whole bunch of

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,840
guys in Parliament just kind of doing

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,300
some stuff this is the stuff that

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,790
happened that made our country it's true

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,930
and this is how it happened so this is

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,030
another one we did where we were doing

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,800
big big hits of of the database and

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,160
going find me every event in history

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,390
where somebody left the Senate because

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760
the Senate's much smaller it's much

00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,710
easier to work with so show me every

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,630
person that left every political party

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,340
they were in graph it over time and show

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,220
me the breakdown of history nobody's

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,800
made this graph I made this graph and

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,120
this is how it worked so for those of

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,330
you who don't know the Liberal Party

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,650
only actually cropped up in 1944 before

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,810
that it was like a bunch of proto

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,340
liberal parties but the Labour Party

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,690
actually started quite early and there's

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,150
disputes as to whether or not they

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,950
actually were pre Federation or not but

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,200
yeah really really long so the green

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,090
here not the greens

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,590
that's the Nationals Nationals have been

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,500
using the color green in politics for

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,780
much much longer this screen is the

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,820
Greens here you see all of your lambie's

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,480
and your Lazarus's and all of your

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,030
political rogues from the cross bench

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:49,420
and this one somebody pointed out this

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:51,640
squashed elephant can see this squashed

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,460
elephant is the Australian Democrats

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,530
they they kind of took a lot of seats in

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,630
the Senate and then just just became a

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,060
squashed elephant I guess so yeah like

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,080
this this again this is your story this

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,250
is what happened this is what we did

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,170
this is this is how like why we do it so

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,290
and then lastly one of the other ones

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,460
was lots of dates in history people love

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,620
dates they want to go what happened

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,890
today tell me about today so this is

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,240
what happened today not not very much

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,180
not really a lot so there was a

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,890
by-election in 2000 in 2000 Casual

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,170
Vacancy so somebody's obviously left the

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,940
Senate and been reappointed in 1958

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,380
somebody resigned there was a reshuffle

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,170
in the Menzies cabinet today only one

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,390
guy got dropped out so there's probably

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,329
a story there and a bunch of people were

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,740
born so happy birthday to them but this

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,850
is what happened so we can kind of go

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,860
back and go okay show me all the dates

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,200
in history and so this is this is a part

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,610
this is the other this is the other one

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,170
the mandatory architecture slide I say

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,019
mandatory because I'm just bad at these

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,850
like eventually like if I didn't I have

00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,250
to try really hard and I still mess them

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,079
up this is what we actually built so the

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,720
handbook is predominantly built on

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,279
Django and Python based framework so

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,990
it's based on haystack haystack is known

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,269
okay cool haystacks an amazing tool for

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,649
search basically it provides you a

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,420
django s-- query set wrapper around a

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,970
number of really well supported search

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,980
engines so alas to search we used woosh

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,079
because it's all Python based so it's a

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,329
little bit slow but it's just dead set

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,980
easy to get set up and then we had to

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,019
connect it with all the gray stuff is

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,209
all the stuff that I T wanted us to kind

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,620
of work with so if you're working at in

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,230
an organization where they say all

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,680
Python like Django it's a little bit too

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,870
hard I'm on film to say we at Parliament

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,269
House were able to get Django connected

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,760
up through an IRS like web service to

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,500
LDAP with all of the security required

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,120
that that you know in Parliament House

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,640
has so if you can find an organization

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,160
that has high like security standards

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,220
than us I'd like to know so we got it

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,570
set up like this and this corner over

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,149
here was actually not as hard as you

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,649
might think but you know still a little

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:07,130
bit difficult but we did it so you can

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:13,610
run django pretty much anywhere um why

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:15,170
django it's kind of cool I say to Pete

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,269
like like for me as a Python developer

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,579
one of the big challenges we had was we

00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,990
were constantly throwing away code like

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:23,329
I said at the beginning we didn't know

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,890
what this would look like we didn't have

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,660
an idea of what political histories

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,699
would look like so the ability for us to

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,110
throw away a database and in our you

00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,480
know development versions kind of spin

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,949
up an SQLite database and just delete it

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,750
and rebuild it and delete it and rebuild

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:38,089
it and delete it and rebuild it was

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,040
really good for us like we we were a j'l

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,250
in the colloquial sense of the term like

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,900
we

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,190
kept building and not knowing what we

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,740
were doing in the thought we did it like

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,740
we did something um but why Django is

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,260
boring like that's what I said to iti

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,620
said like it's not exciting like it's

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,120
supported it's it's it's like it's like

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,880
something said infrastructure it's a

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,920
framework it's it's there like it's not

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,110
something that's crazy and esoteric you

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,340
install it and it's done and that was a

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,960
big part like that's a big part of this

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,060
talk is like Jenga is boring now and

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:17,150
that is a slight that is an exciting

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:18,260
idea it's exciting in the sense that it

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,930
means that you can get it running

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,250
anywhere without hassle without pushback

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,510
because it just is and that's good now

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,310
up until this point I've talked about

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,960
our successes and and if you've laughed

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,980
before you're gonna laugh even harder

00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:37,610
from now on in we came up with this term

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,440
that we we call data banana skins data

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,450
messes you up like these are the

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,100
slip-ups that we had that prevented us

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,660
from actually doing this well the

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,589
lessons that we learned around dealing

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,600
with very very incomplete data sets so

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:56,780
this is Francis McLean born 1863 when

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:01,130
don't know there is no record of his

00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,480
birth date at all probably 1963 and I

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,750
say probably because we're not even sure

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,190
that so how did we do it well there were

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,440
a couple of ways that we could do it and

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,910
and none of them really worked well we

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,290
could store it as a string but that

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,480
meant when we were doing all of our date

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,520
manipulation on the database we didn't

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,980
have the ability to use actual date

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,380
times we could store it as a date and

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,940
then we'd have to have some way of

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,670
recording the fact that certain dates

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,260
were false there are people born on the

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,860
1st of January so that's not an option

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,390
so ok we then turned to there was a

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,330
library that we kind of pulled in and

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:37,790
ripped apart and rebuilt for multi-field

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,010
storage so we would store a birth date

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,750
and a birth confidence together so that

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,520
on the back end on the database we'd

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,690
have an approximation of the date but

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,490
when we display that we could have

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,339
granularity around the depth of that

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,990
date that would show so so yeah that was

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,580
a big part of it and and the reason that

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,990
we took that approach was because of

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,020
thank you this

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,430
city for working with dirty data but

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,000
also being able to do those date

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,320
manipulations within the database this

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,939
one's a really good one if you're not

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,480
from Canberra look up oh you're gonna

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,819
love this

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,949
king of malli not a king not Irish

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,860
probably not even eligible to be elected

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:20,540
to Parliament King O'Malley was like all

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,689
of his political histories are so

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,689
hilarious to look up he was a very brash

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:29,240
North American probably from the US who

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,179
moved to the seat of Darwin in Tasmania

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,500
when Darwin was in Tasmania and became

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,860
known for being a loud brash American

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,240
and that was enough to get him elected

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,740
people in Canberra loved him because he

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,820
loved Canberra he was one of the people

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,010
who said let's put the capital in

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,150
Canberra but he said he was from Quebec

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,570
because that would mean he was eligible

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,179
to actually be in Parliament there's no

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,520
way we could store that like we you

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:56,210
can't store an approximate like country

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,470
of birth for again trivia purposes King

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,010
omalley is also the reason that the

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,270
Labour Party is spelt oor so if you've

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,400
ever wanted to know why the difference

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,750
is there King omalley believed that the

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,920
American spelling would take over

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,030
because at the time American spelling

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,400
was quite big in the Commonwealth

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,140
nations and he said let's get ahead of

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,600
the times let's be forward thinkers

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,900
spell the Labour Party Oh R and he was

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,580
wrong there's also really nice pub

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,620
called King omalley dedicated just to

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:27,470
this guy's story it's great he was that

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:31,160
way oh there you did not drink did not

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,400
drink yet has a pub named after him we

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,710
had lots of just dirty data like data

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,679
that only cropped up once that we had to

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,110
store lots of generic foreign keys that

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,970
we needed to work with but it worked we

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,770
were able to get it to work this one was

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,590
was mostly for a library conference that

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,120
I presented it out looking at storing

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,100
authorship details politicians do write

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,240
a lot and we record a lot of that

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,250
because we're interested in what they

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,200
did previously but being able to manage

00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,030
where we don't know what facts are going

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,830
to come up being able to record that was

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,630
necessary so we had lots and lots of

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,450
generic foreign keys to link people to

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,790
parties people and people parties and

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,190
and electrics and all that jazz

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,720
and this is my favor one so if you can

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,900
tweak this I'm trying to get this to

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,040
catch on Jacobson's law is if Excel

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,810
Canon misinterpret your data it will and

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,870
it will do it in the worst way so

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,580
Carolyn Jacobson is was a

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,800
parliamentarian in the 80s not

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,020
particularly of note the reason that she

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,730
cropped up for me is because her

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,150
parliamentary identifier which is public

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:39,220
knowledge it's on the APH website is 0e

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:42,020
for which Excel decided really helpfully

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:48,440
occasionally not even consistently to

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:54,100
say I think that's 0 ^ for no no Excel

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:58,820
bat we also had issues of dates mostly

00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,110
19 1863 was the 5th of February I think

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,570
you have 5th of February I might no

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,700
that's not right

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,980
and and this one this is obviously a

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,900
date for crying out loud except I'm

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,940
sorry I'm speaking directly to the Excel

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:15,410
development team now this is obviously a

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,670
date store it as a date not a number and

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,160
these are the other ones that we came

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,200
across these are the assumptions we got

00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,870
wrong when trying to build a picture of

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:31,820
political histories ministers need to be

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:34,010
elected constitutionally wrong did not

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,240
know - it's happened twice both in

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,090
Federation thank you

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,170
both in Federation but yeah look it up

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,880
it's in the Constitution you'd be a

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,180
minister for three months without being

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,300
elected if someone resigns only one

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,100
person will take their place

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,200
no sometimes someone will resign and

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,330
take their own place someone will resign

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,430
and no one will take their place and

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,170
sometimes someone will resign twice and

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,410
someone will take only one of those it

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,400
was a huge mess you like somebody

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,010
resigning before they were meant to

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,030
leave someone can never replace

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:10,010
themselves again patently false if you

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,020
win an election you are elected again

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,430
this is this happen quite recently in

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,920
Western Australia with the Senate counts

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,240
somebody was formally elected we started

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,160
adding them in we had all of their

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
records and then the election changed

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,170
and then we had to go back and remove

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,730
them but you know

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,500
consequences of data meant there were

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,410
issues there and if you do everything

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,860
right you only have to do it once I can

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,630
tell you that's not true we scrapped

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,980
this many many times and one of the

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,680
reasons why I say Django is also means

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,130
because we scrapped everything multiple

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,420
times timelines for this as you've seen

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,820
we've already released two components

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,140
and this is an open source piece of work

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,270
we've got an internal and we've been

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,850
doing a lot of testing on it and we're

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:52,700
hoping to seed it out as an open source

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:56,300
library by the end of the year pending

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,030
approvals and such and these are the

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,280
lessons data is messy not just

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,290
historical data all data start again

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,310
Excel eats your data good data is hard

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:08,900
to come by this is the summary we've got

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,610
it up and it's it's actually like it's

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,050
really cool in the sense of being able

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,060
to demonstrate the power of open source

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,130
software and the ability for like

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,560
data-driven applications to provide

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,660
answers and that's it if you want to

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,610
reach me on there you can tweet the

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:27,460
parliamentary library that's pol lib or

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,460
pol library oh yeah thank you very much

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,740
thank you very much saying for that

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,730
fascinating insight into everything

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,250
that's wrong with our political

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,280
democracy apparently do we have any

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,410
questions if you do everything we do so

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,850
thanks for the great talk

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,370
you mentioned at the end that you're

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,280
planning on opening this project do you

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,250
have an idea how much the Australian

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,210
governmental structure or the

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,090
constraints you've built on top of that

00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,960
are usable by other governments that are

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,590
not in all related to Australia all the

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
Commonwealth

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,150
yeah absolutely so we we looked there's

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,070
a Jenga implementation of open Popolo

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,570
that wasn't quite fit for us so we

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:17,150
rebuilt a lot of that in the sense that

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,410
when you look at political systems

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,940
around the world they often will have a

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,590
chamber of some description

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,320
they'll have members of a chamber that

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,120
will have you know you know positions

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,679
within those chambers so we designed it

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,960
in a very very generic way with the

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,450
intent that we built a generic framework

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,880
for any political system to be built on

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,460
top of and then built specifications for

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,840
ours specifically on top of that so

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,130
we've already spoken with a lot of the

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,860
states which have their own

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,910
idiosyncrasies as well to manage that

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,460
kind of information so yeah hopefully

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:51,520
there'll be some up taking other at

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,520
least similar you know bicameral areas

00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,740
thank you very much you're using

00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,960
Microsoft sequel in obviously a Windows

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,669
environment and all of the django

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,429
documentation and the django community

00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:06,770
seems to repeat the mantra of just used

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,950
Postgres and a lot of people are using

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,830
Linux have you found any fundamental

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,350
limitations of django because of the

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:19,850
environment that you're running in there

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:22,520
were there was one I hit it was text

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,570
concatenation behind the scenes and I

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,919
think that was the only thing that

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,510
Microsoft's SQL didn't have but no like

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,660
we were able to get it up and running

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,880
with very little difficulty like I I can

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,350
understand like I'm when I'm looking at

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,980
server administration for my own

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,720
purposes

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,080
like Linux is much easier it's much more

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,090
supported but ICT said you can have it

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,740
as Django on Windows or we're going to

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,600
have to do a lot of work to kind of

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,520
potentially rebuild it so we kind of

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,010
went okay let's do Windows let's see how

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,220
it works and it it just worked there

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:59,539
were really no difficulties at all

00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:02,210
it's boring is the punchline I'm just

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:06,110
wondering about the the the dates that

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:09,110
you have in incomplete dates um did you

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,779
choose to store when you only know the

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,860
year as the first of January on the

00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:17,960
database no so we gave people the

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,490
ability to store as much of the date

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,669
they knew so there are cases where we

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,919
knew that it was the first week of June

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,350
for example so we could say sixth and

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,140
give an accuracy of that down to the

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,820
month so when we were doing calculations

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,490
we'd be able to get a rough

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,350
approximation but you but on the

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,840
database we stored an actual date but

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,070
you rounded down to the lowest like the

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,679
first of the month or the yes of the

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,710
year yeah wouldn't the middle it would

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,230
be more for we never really got into

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,620
that much steps and again because you're

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,080
talking about unknowns we just would

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,390
take whatever we could work with it very

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,190
much dependent on the purpose for what

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,580
we were using the date for so sometimes

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,289
like when it was when it was for data

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,029
based calculations it was the date as it

00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,679
was stored directly when it was for

00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,669
display purposes we would truncate it in

00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:08,990
different ways when it was for

00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:11,059
visualization we'd put it in different

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,590
ways as well so for anything that was a

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,640
start date of an event it would be at

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,880
the beginning of the session so

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,140
beginning of the year if it was an end

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,760
date we just put it at the end of the

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,340
year to kind of get as much coverage for

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
visualization purposes and for events we

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,570
just make it straight in the middle so

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,890
it like dates very broadly and how you

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:39,340
can use them when you don't know what

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:42,710
they are fascinating thank you a

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:45,620
question how do you convert the

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,510
information from the database to paper

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,840
you said you're going to publish the yep

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,919
a lot of that so we're we haven't been

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,289
looking at that for the first release

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,970
but we we go through a publishing house

00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,220
for the production of the print handbook

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,150
and that's done through

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,480
through XML doc book kind of format so

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,370
we just be using Django template and

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,920
exporting like a bulk export of content

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,280
from the database in some paper ish form

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,090
for consumption by the publishers HTML

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,200
PDF for the publishers what most so it's

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,460
a form of doc book like it was a

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,870
proprietary form of doc book that we

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,940
have to be looking at working with but

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,740
because it's XML were able to produce it

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:30,290
using the Django templating framework

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:32,750
thank you hey great talk I was wondering

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,270
that since you were like generating

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,280
reports and whatever from data arranging

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,320
back from a hundred years ago was there

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,660
was there anything special we had to do

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,179
in terms of optimizing queries or did

00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,300
you just struggle running it all day

00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,190
long or something the queries were a lot

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,990
of the time cached with cases like dates

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,250
because you know when somebody was

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,440
elected a hundred years ago hasn't

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,059
changed we were able to do a lot of

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,520
caching for for a lot of the queries and

00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,710
a lot of the visualizations the data set

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,929
as long as the data set is is actually

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,360
not very big we're only talking about I

00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,910
think it's 1,600 discrete individuals

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,320
with you know a bunch of events around

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,990
it so it's not a big data set so we're

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,320
actually able to kind of hit it really

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:18,770
in optimally unfortunately but still get

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,330
really good stuff coming out as a fellow

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,760
Dever that's forced to use Microsoft

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,770
sequel what are you using to connect and

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,920
how much do you have to go outside the

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:31,610
ORM to get what you need to be we were

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,350
using Django mssql it's a library it's

00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,830
on pip it's really easily available it

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,630
was like just installed and done and we

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,070
didn't have any problems with the Orang

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,330
that I can think of off the top of my

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,890
head certainly nothing that bit us hard

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,929
enough to say this is bad and your 2.7

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:56,300
for SQL Server not no further

00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:58,460
oh no yes yes yes okay one last question

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,280
just to round out here connecting this

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,020
talk to Donna's originally the Donna

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,260
extolled the virtues of being involved

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:09,980
in government as a as a promotion

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,240
platform for for Drupal I had absolutely

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,510
no idea that we were being used inside

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,320
the

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:18,560
metry library so what is there any scope

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,840
for using this as a Hey look government

00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,450
people we can we can do cool things or

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,040
is our your doors shut in terms of you

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,140
can't really promote your arms

00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,820
mentioning if things are there's no like

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,400
absolutely like it's recorded I'm here

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm talking about it I'd be very glad if

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,030
people were to talk about this project

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,530
like this is the project itself is we're

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,730
intending to go public with a lot of

00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,720
this documentation with a lot of this

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,950
information we've been we've had

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,020
discussions very public discussions with

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,120
other cultural institutions in Canberra

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,590
so the National Library and the Museum

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,180
of Australian democracy which is really

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,010
great you should go there's a lot of

00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,560
exciting stuff in Canberra

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,960
I thought laugh at that one come on

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,700
there is a lot of really cool stuff in

00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,780
Canberra know so we've been talking with

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,310
a lot of people about this so it's not a

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,890
secret and the intent is that this is

00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:06,620
public information like it's not a

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,270
secret when Tony Abbott for example was

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,920
born like it's not a secret where he was

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,720
born it's not a secret what he's been

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,400
doing for in politics for quite a long

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,200
time these are all public pieces of

00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,340
knowledge that are recorded and printed

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,770
and you can go to your local library and

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,810
can get it so yeah like please talk

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,030
about this please please please talk

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,230
about this as much as you guys want and

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,330
yeah we're at the parliamentary library

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,990
we're doing awesome cool stuff well

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,990
