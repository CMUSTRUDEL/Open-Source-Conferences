Django CMS, Mezzanine and Wagtail are the three most popular Django-based content management systems; all three have kept (or, in Wagtail's case, gained) their popularity because they are so different to each other. In many ways, from their fundamental data models right through to how they approach their content editing UIs, each one has a very different take on how a CMS should work.

This talk will explore the different approaches, strengths and weaknesses of each CMS, and what they mean for you as a developer and for your content editors.
