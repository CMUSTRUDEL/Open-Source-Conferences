okay ladies and gentlemen let's get

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,680
these lightning talks underway for those

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,660
who are new to lightning talks the first

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,870
rule of lightning talks is you don't

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,580
know you do talk about lighting dogs the

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,279
only only real rule is that it is five

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,539
minutes no more but it may be less you

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,279
are not required to talk for five

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,260
minutes you can have slides you may not

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,789
have slides you may even as amber is

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,099
about to demonstrate live code although

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,910
love of all things holy I don't know why

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,730
you would so yes you have five minutes

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,260
as I have got a timer here as we get

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,940
closer and closer and although an amber

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,520
is also displaying the very latest in my

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,320
crib it fashion as we get closer and

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,600
closer to five five minutes i will move

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,870
closer and closer to the stage and then

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,309
i will be on the stage and then are we

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,230
throwing people off the stage when it

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,030
hits five minutes so so yes without

00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:04,619
further ado we will start the clock now

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:06,750
on amber and your time starts now okay

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,210
see how you start now it's hot brilliant

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,740
okay so there's something I've been

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,570
working on past couple of months is

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,189
you've got twisted and twist is all good

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,930
but then you've got a sink I on nursing

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,560
careers we would now what if you want to

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,180
use both because like you want to use a

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,710
twisted thing because we've got a whole

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,259
bunch of stuff that's only in twisted

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,640
that don't have a sink IO employment a

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,869
shins yet but maybe you want to use

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,170
something that's going on Nathan cayo

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,869
implementing like a opg or something so

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,150
if you look on on the service screen

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:42,799
that I can't make any bigger I apologize

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:46,079
I have any example of the new in twisted

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,810
15.5 which will be the next release that

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,570
we have an async I reactor which is an

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,380
adapter between a a sink i/o event loop

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,299
and a twisted reactor so we install that

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,890
install it there and that means you can

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,469
use like UV loop or any of those

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,290
alternative async i/o event loop

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,530
implementations and it'll just work so

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,120
here we have got just some code from

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,660
pretty much the aao htp website where it

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,560
talks about here's

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,830
some fetching so that's all good and

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,330
then but this bit here is pretty much we

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,830
want it to be twisted because we might

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,940
want to fit it into a twisted

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,920
application so in the next release the

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,680
one after this one which is currently in

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,790
pre-release we will have adapter

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,790
functions that will let you take a

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,440
future and put it into a deferred and a

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,360
deferred and put it into a future and

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,310
let's actually write that one right now

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,430
because you know so basically the

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,460
problem is is that we can't just wait on

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,110
these natively because there's a bug in

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:59,650
a sink I owe to future can't could

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,780
search so there's a bug in a Cinco they

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,360
only let you async await things that are

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,400
actually a Cinco tasks so we have to do

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:14,020
this really ugly thing where we go okay

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:16,840
so we got importation KO kayo dot future

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,630
yeah future make future I've gotta give

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:26,500
a loop so let's just none wait now I

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:36,940
know I should realize that there's a

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:39,790
problem with this yeah so we've got that

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,360
and I know if we've gotta actually make

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,520
that okay so one of the great things is

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,180
that twisted has a reactor and it does

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,220
stuff now a Cinco decided screw that

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,440
let's actually make the reactor part of

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,270
the future so that means that a future

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,040
actually knows what event loop it's

00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,600
running on because when you do a call

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,489
back it actually doesn't call that

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,050
function what it does is that tells the

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,150
event loop to go call that functions

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,910
sometime later which means that you end

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,610
up with a bit fair queuing but you end

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,310
up with problems that you know things

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,950
don't happen right away and it'll only

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,780
do it when the reactor when the event

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,940
loop actually gets to it which is like

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,609
some questionable amount of time later

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,870
so we've got to give it a loop and we're

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,090
gonna get a sinker and we go make a

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,240
future with the loop and then we do a

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,970
cinco y dot

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:37,530
yeah so we go we have the two thirds and

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:45,940
call back that's actually going to be a

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:59,020
if that's a great variable name salts is

00:04:45,940 --> 00:05:00,910
that the API yes it is don't know it's

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,140
got me a lambda because we're failures

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:08,950
basing one minute yes yes thank you so

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:13,650
let's go F dot set exception is it is

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:24,790
that the area so knowing that needs for

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:34,630
that no let's call that e value turn so

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:43,990
now we should be able to in here you're

00:05:34,630 --> 00:06:00,790
giving me stress I'm type owing because

00:05:43,990 --> 00:06:05,650
of that stress and 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 x

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,240
yeah so I've got the pie works here so

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,250
because I don't have time just pretend

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,610
that works and that's amazing and all

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,610
about

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,050
also I'll be sprinting untwisted at the

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,480
sprints if you ever want to get into it

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:25,280
so who's next thank you very much amber

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,930
let this be a cautionary tale to all

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,330
about the about doing live coding

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,810
enlightening dogs stresses the stresses

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:38,330
of me we will have fun but we will have

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:44,420
order alright so next we're just getting

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:48,530
Tim hooked up at the moment hence

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:57,440
quickly amongst ourselves Marcus you're

00:06:48,530 --> 00:07:08,030
ready to go next one yep alright special

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:11,870
wheels and hmm it's watching me why is

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,180
the Canada arm looking at me oh I sure

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,950
need to mirror displays you right I

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:24,020
tried to get a full screen hang on i

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:34,280
need to mirror displays now roster did

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:47,390
Dean do that's not what I want hey plane

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:49,010
de plane de plane there did anyone come

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:56,420
up with a good punch line for that talk

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:57,620
title the bird too sorry bird is not the

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:04,100
word do not even claim the bird is the

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:06,740
word mirror displays good all right are

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,360
we good to go I think we probably

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,420
approximating me good to go we are

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:20,630
approximately good to go all right

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:20,630
oh it's so pretty spinning beachball

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:32,160
whoop whoop and i'm here with

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:35,970
anticipation I look that should be good

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,100
enough are we good to go look let me see

00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:47,880
if I press space we go to the next slide

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:51,750
and if we do we're fine alright your

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,070
time starts now okay so prototyping user

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,750
interfaces with Django rest framework

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,290
rest framework is an easy way to create

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,030
create a REST API for your django app

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,830
and then you might have front-end

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,900
developers who or mobile developers who

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,300
will develop an app that talks to that

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,610
api and all of their functionality is

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,830
going to accessing the data through that

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,930
API but wouldn't it be nice to be able

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,600
to develop a way to have a way of

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,910
prototyping what that mobile app might

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,010
be like using the familiar Django

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,420
template framework system you know

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,450
everything we're used to in the old kind

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,830
of you know version of web apps where

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,440
you have a template which takes a

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,940
context and renders and a view and all

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,220
the rest of it so I've come up with this

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,820
thing called a rule which is badly

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,360
pronounced German for peaceful or

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:50,420
restful and it's a class-based view

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:54,390
mixin to provide access to this rest api

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,490
by your template conflict context so

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,380
what it's doing is it's a single view

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,420
and it is putting into your context the

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,950
api root view and i'll show you what

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,290
that means later in in the context of

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,360
rest framework all the registered list

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,800
views you'll get query parameters

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,280
because you need that to maintain

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,900
application state it supplies these as

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,970
Python objects that provide access to

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,140
the nested data structures of whatever

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,580
data you're getting back from the API

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,070
and it's one single view that takes a

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,810
your template name from the from the URL

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,880
which then refers to depending which

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,560
template you've got and you can have

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,850
different aspects of view of your run

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:40,580
over your API sorry your interface

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:43,290
through different templates so using the

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,020
other Django rest framework tutorial

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,580
I've just added a single line to the

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,160
URLs that bottom one there we're saying

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,520
really template name blah blah blah fuse

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,330
rig view as view here is the view you

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,010
have to write as you can see there's not

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,530
a lot of stuff going on there and it's

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,000
the one view so this is what the

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,790
tutorial looks like it provides an API

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,620
route where we can access snippets and

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,570
users and this is what a snippet looks

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,740
like this is code snippets and i'm just

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,910
showing this to provide a little bit of

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:17,970
context so now i'm going to show a bit

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:22,460
of HTML sorry this is a you know django

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,390
template which is accessing the snippets

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,610
variable which we've put in there three

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,290
of context so for our in snippet results

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,830
and then we're going to construct this

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:35,490
link and we've got this get parameter

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,350
snippet equals r dot R or URL and we're

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,630
giving it up title all this is coming

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:45,090
from the API injected via that single

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:48,870
single line view here's a bit of a

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:52,800
template code for an eight before am for

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,260
a single snippet and now that the risk

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,970
of there being a great disaster let me

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:04,320
just quickly show what that looks like

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:07,020
do these people never learn yeah ok so

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,750
imagine a web page with a link you click

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:14,040
the link and it takes you to another web

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,920
page the implementation uses the rest

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,540
framework test api client so obviously

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,780
this is not intended for a production

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,760
use it's just a nice way of hooking in

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,730
without doing all that nasty age the

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,410
HTTP bin business and we wrap the

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,150
responses we get so you're not just

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,620
getting a piece of JSON back you're

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,450
getting back something that you can then

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,100
use to go inside and say well actually I

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,350
want this and give me another URL and

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,339
then I can take that URL and go go and

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,779
follow that for

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:46,129
it's through the API that's a work in

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:48,300
progress and if with our remaining

00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:52,230
something approximating one minute

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,639
here's one minute let's see if we swim

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,139
oh here we are so here's our code

00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,910
snippets we've iterated all over the

00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:02,819
call the code snippets of which there is

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:08,490
one and if I click the link we go to

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:10,439
this funny URL so snippet snippet is the

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,379
template name it's pulling out and then

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:15,749
this is a argument which it's taking as

00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,040
a state so it knows which particular

00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:18,509
sleeper that's going to retrieve and

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,889
it's displayed the snippet and the

00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:25,170
language and the owner and blah blah

00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:27,240
blah and for the final bit actually

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,180
probably not going to see a photo so far

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,019
too small there's a little bit of code

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,699
and it's really ego so um yeah look it's

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,139
very much work in progress just to

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:41,639
demonstrate there's a way of doing this

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:51,480
and trying to make developing apps a bit

00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:54,929
easier thank you and under time as well

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,089
so thank you very much Tim next up is

00:13:54,929 --> 00:14:00,120
Marcus and if we can get Sam if you were

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:09,379
ready to we have we have a multitude of

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:09,379
Sam's so test yep

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,350
Marcus is an old hand here so we'll know

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,899
he'll be under five minutes of course he

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,110
will wouldn't possibly have I think I

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,670
never even managed to get four minutes

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,649
on the lightning talk I think I always

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,480
finished earlier right all right let's

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:35,459
see just go so as a follow up for my

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,800
talk from before on two-factor

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,500
authentication I remember that a while

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,630
ago that wasn't 2015 I read this tree to

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,610
online and ssh log in as I you log in by

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,680
an ssh to some server that generates a

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,820
token which you can then use to

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,490
authenticate against your django side

00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:01,140
mission accept the challenge accepted so

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:03,420
um I'm not calling down I think I think

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,640
I answered like half an hour later I

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,570
think I got an idea how to do that so I

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,399
came up with django ssh login and this

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,899
is a proof of concept do not use that in

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:18,720
production disclaimer as before and

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:23,250
totally like Hector down in half an hour

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,610
so how does it work essentially I don't

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,440
see my screen here essentially I came up

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,290
with an author separate authentication

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,270
back and that takes a key and then and

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:39,600
the user and figures out the rest from

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:41,730
there and then I have a model which

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,339
starts the key and creates one unsafe

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:49,140
and no real magic they're happening

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:52,890
anyway and there's a useful py which

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:56,310
does the lock in validation well nothing

00:15:52,890 --> 00:16:00,740
finds you there either the interesting

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:03,360
part is the well generating Yuki and I

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,670
create take a user that I get from

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,880
something from the the from an argument

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:11,250
I create a new key for that user and

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,850
then i create the URL that i want to

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:25,070
present the user to log into and well

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:27,750
this is big let's run run server here

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:33,780
that works watch myself

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:38,370
that's one SSH localhost here I get a

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,780
link open link and there I am if you

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:53,520
don't first me let me lock all together

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:57,210
then quickly so how does it work how

00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,320
much time do I have left I managed to

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:06,209
fall four minutes SSH has this thing

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:09,959
command execution in when you log in to

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,600
the server so you can run a command if a

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,640
user authenticates successfully and then

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,770
terminate the connection which allows

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,150
which prevents the user from actually

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:23,130
doing anything further wire acetate you

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,380
have the config in here which

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,800
essentially called spuyten with a

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,620
managed py with a generator key for that

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,550
user disabled bunch of things just for

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,970
the sake of security if you manage to

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:43,860
find a way to automate this process sure

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,450
that's all you actually need and when

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,540
you lock it when you try to SSH into

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,720
github or some of the get servers out

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,190
there you actually see a list of

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,780
apposite orys you have access to which

00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:00,650
is quite nice one minute left alright

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,650
yep

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,270
see and I didn't even need to get

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,270
threatening mixed up his Sam Spencer

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:39,370
yeah I'm all trapped um hello again I

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:41,080
was up here earlier so I was here

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,090
earlier wait so your time starts now

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,710
very cool I was here earlier talking

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,630
about some of the cool stuff we were

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,110
doing at at parliamentary library and

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,360
during Josh's talk on doing cool SQL

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,920
things with with with Django I thought

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,480
it might be appropriate to to look a

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,670
little bit more of one of the things

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,200
that I was working on and we saw our

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,480
boss who was with us earlier talking

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,670
about sales but he's changed jobs now

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,830
and he knows we've got all sorts of

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,300
stuff in our database which he's seen

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,520
here so this is a Shangguan spaghetti

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,780
meatballs we've seen that boring so I

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,120
can hover on that and the boss is gone

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,040
or there's so much stuff in there go and

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,179
find this tell me what politicians have

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,530
served in the health ministry from the

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,090
eastern states give me the name position

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,530
later and a number of times I've been

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,020
elected I needed two counts on the

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,790
database now god that's going to be

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,790
tough fortunately I've got to back up

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,400
behind me but just in case I know all

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,980
these people are persons of interest I

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,800
know that I need their name and I know

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:45,190
that I need their ministerial position

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:48,100
position dot label that should bring me

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:55,809
something nope miss Val ministerial

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:59,230
appointment there we go that's taking a

00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,330
little bit of time it's pulling

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,620
quite a lot of stuff out so it's running

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,630
behind the scenes and it's querying my

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,330
database to do stuff there we go there's

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,640
a list of every parliamentarian and all

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,799
of their ministries that they've been in

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,120
that's kind of neat and for the sake of

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:18,880
time I'm going to shrink it down and

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,410
just say this is what it looks like find

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,580
me a list of ministerial appointments

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,950
with the position with the label in in

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,080
case insensitive is health find me a

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,120
list of states find me a list of people

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,919
concatenate there miss ministerial

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,840
appointments their labels and when they

00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,280
are elected and sort it by the number of

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,860
times they were elected and it returns

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:44,470
something looks like this really really

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:46,750
quickly really really quickly so I can

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,880
do that across the entire database now

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,830
like I've done all that really really

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,330
simply and anybody can go along and they

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,179
can query my django database that's

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:59,320
really really neat how does it work good

00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,940
question audience that works it works

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,970
just like this it's actually really

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:07,270
really straightforward so the how for

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,450
for the query is I take a string and I

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:13,419
split it up and first of all I page down

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,320
I do a split on the equal sign and I get

00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:18,580
two more strings because Django's

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,280
database ORM is actually really really

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,330
cool I can get rid of the dots the only

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,799
reason the dots are there is when

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,260
somebody's typing in you can control

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,480
left and right to select text but you

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,250
can't with double underscore so let's

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,010
just replace those with double

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,380
underscores great ok cool but that's a

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,900
django query i'll make it a dictionary

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:43,150
and I'll quads it for query set done

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,500
okay that's that's my filtering done but

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm still going to get back a whole

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,130
bunch of objects that's going to be

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,110
really really slow and when I'm trying

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,760
to query across a whole bunch of stuff I

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,610
need to do something with it so here is

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,929
my name the the concatenation of all the

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,870
ministries I've been in so that they're

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:01,630
not multiple rows and the this the

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,880
electorate's a beanie and I just do that

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,030
okay I split it by oh I've got all of my

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,940
forms back from a view I replace the

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,140
dots with double underscores and then I

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,909
moved contact to the end so there's a

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,879
little bit of text recognition then

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:18,460
determine what is a valid aggregation

00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:20,320
and shifts it to the end and then it

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,749
just values it so what it does is it

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,669
just args this one throws it into values

00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:27,820
and from those two now i filtered and

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:32,889
returned just a very flat list of values

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:37,509
from the database and I've got now hmm

00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:41,559
I've gotta escape at it I've got that so

00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:43,359
that works and that's a pluggable django

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,869
app so i'll show you what i did it not

00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:49,119
one minute mm-hmm okay so go in so I've

00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,529
got my database and you like look I

00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,119
don't care about parliamentarians it's

00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,470
not really my business or what I want to

00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,109
do is I want to actually install it so

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,940
you go and you climb it from github you

00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:59,710
get the data interrogator and you see

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,019
all these nifty jokes about police in

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,639
there you throw any objects that you

00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,499
don't want to be withdrawn from the

00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,599
database into witness protection and it

00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:10,029
won't be withdrawn and that's where you

00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,320
get it so this is a little app that I've

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:13,149
been working on it's much much much less

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,409
mature than anything else and if you

00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,340
want to kind of work on it and that'll

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,570
be great and you wanna throw a pull

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,679
request and see how it works pretty cool

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,679
it's only about like 200 lines

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:33,299
okay I next figure is David Holden all

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:36,539
right now hold it oh sorry yes uh who

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:48,840
held the slides I'm sorry oh I left too

00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:51,030
quick No so Rudy and stick your pocket

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,190
all right great all right your time

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,690
starts now ends David holder I work for

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,380
the National computational

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,630
infrastructure which is Australia's peak

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,200
scientific computing body if you're

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:08,520
working for CSR Oh or the Bureau of

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,860
Meteorology or doing a PhD somewhere and

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,510
in Australia and you need access to a

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,150
lot of scientific computing resources

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,179
you can apply the time on on the main

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:22,919
NCI machine and hopefully do your

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:25,710
science so this talk this is my ad hoc

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,630
lightning talk on the Django project

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,510
that I'm working on and that is the the

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:34,380
system that gives people access to the

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:37,230
NCI facilities just to give you a bit of

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,580
a scale of what I'm talking about the

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:44,850
the main machine at at NCI has I think

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:48,000
67,000 cause last time I looked and has

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,159
a sort of one megawatt transformer

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,080
outside the size of a railway locomotive

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,260
so it's a fairly big installation I'm

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,510
and we have you know thousands of users

00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,630
around the country so yes surprise

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:05,700
surprise we use Django to to manage user

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:12,929
access to to all of this and it does job

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:16,409
it fits the bill the the main feature so

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:18,059
the system is is called mancini the name

00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:19,980
is chosen just because it's a string

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,429
that rolls off the tongue and has the

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,500
substring NCI in it and the way it

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:27,750
differs from a lot of django apps is

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,159
that it consists of a number of loosely

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:34,770
coupled components now you know coupling

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,540
components into Django is not new people

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,610
you sell at django selleria zone

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,620
sound it to sort of formwork cues and

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,410
things this is a sort of more

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,900
lightweight version of celery and that

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,520
is it just uses the database as a sort

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,410
of communication layer between its

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,110
different parts now the main reason it

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:56,580
has this sort of loosely coupled design

00:25:52,110 --> 00:26:02,130
is primarily security what we what we

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:04,290
really don't want is a system where the

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,490
the front-end web application where

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,730
people are interacting with their

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:12,300
browser has access to say your LDAP

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:15,120
store and can you or your LDAP service

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,880
and could potentially create users or

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,350
modify any old user in in ldap that

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,660
would be disastrous if the thing got

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,380
hacked if anyone could you had a system

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,390
like that where your web front-end can

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,520
write to build up and do anything it

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,020
likes once that once that web front-end

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,400
gets hacked it's all over your entire

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,650
name space service is is potentially

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,680
corrupted so the idea about we with

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,690
Mancini is that all of the potentially

00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,720
sensitive stuff goes into the database

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,410
as a in a kind of to-do list form and

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,560
then its job of external demons which

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:55,140
also written in Django to look at those

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,740
to-do lists and only only do the things

00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,870
that don't look suspect so for instance

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,720
with this model there's no way that

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:06,300
hopefully there's no way that a

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,480
compromise of the web front-end can

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,730
result in someone I'd say brute forcing

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,520
a password into L that now you could

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,640
potentially compromised front end and

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,960
create a new user in ldap that's not a

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,490
million miles from our standard

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,920
operating procedure where we're handing

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,990
out sort of Michelle accounts to people

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,410
on a daily basis from universities

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:32,210
around the around the country so yep

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:35,160
that's it basically we use Django in

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,810
mancini which is our user access

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,720
management system and has this loosely

00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,160
coupled designed primarily for security

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,460
but it also gives you a bit of our

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,970
reliability one of the back end agents

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,920
as I call them the dope that does things

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,320
when a user get

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,610
created is things like creating their

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,140
home directory all of the sort of

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:59,640
typical minute POSIX kind of stuff and

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,190
it would be nice if that all worked if

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,440
the file system was down so the idea

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:09,150
about with these agencies if let's say

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,800
the file system for such home is down it

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,230
doesn't matter when it comes back what

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,850
will happen is that the the agent that

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,830
looks after creating home directories

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,750
will suddenly see its file system has

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,030
reappeared and can run towards to-do

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,660
list to make the 10 home directories

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:27,680
that have been out you know set approved

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:35,760
while the file system has been offline

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:39,600
that's it thank you very much next up is

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:49,700
Sam Bishop and you want my phone call

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:49,700
see you cuz it's add my knee is playboy

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,100
disclosing your pocket

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:45,370
we do have an adapter all right sir take

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:49,360
it away so wonderful um so yes Django

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:52,210
windmills and sprints oh my Django has a

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,159
sequel problem and I say that quite

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,980
literally because having gone through

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,049
the back end of most or at least more

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,480
than half of the no sequel adapters out

00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,120
there yeah they all start pretending

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,610
that they talk sequel to django pretty

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,799
quickly because gender is kind of

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,200
addicted to sequel not that that's a bad

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,659
thing it's very good it gives us lovely

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,140
things like this but what if we don't

00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:21,850
want the sequel what if maybe we want no

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,740
sequel now that's my windmill but you

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,419
guys out there seemed to enjoy the

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,429
lovely new shiny things hence the

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,460
fantastic new country of post grass

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,630
driver and all the other manner of

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,490
things that have been creeping in as

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,529
postgres and other databases improve

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,110
their features I've seen all manner of

00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:39,039
craziness done with JSON be and I'm sure

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,990
that there are plenty of people who

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,330
would love to do more and be able to get

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,130
Django to support that natively

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,080
everything from fancy admin interfaces

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,450
to all of the data in a JSON be too who

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,750
knows what else people will come up with

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,429
so what can we do about it now usually

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,520
the what we can do about these things is

00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,789
give up the ORM is hard as I'm sure a

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,169
few people in the audience will agree

00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:06,330
but there's an easier way and it lives

00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:09,690
just above the ORM it's the base model

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:12,850
now we've done this before with

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,940
configurable user models now not saying

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,130
it should go the same way but if we can

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,470
configure what a model is for Django

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,960
then we can start really changing this

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,460
and actually make a difference I've

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,289
discussed this with a lot of people over

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,649
the last 12 months in various places

00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,790
face-to-face online etc everyone says

00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:33,460
it's some where

00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,140
looking at but nobody really wants to

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,190
look at it by themselves because it's

00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,810
not a very small problem so if you are

00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,520
actually curious in making this sort of

00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,300
a thing happen be it for your sequel

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:48,040
driver of choice or for no sequel or for

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,510
rest api is on the back end of that some

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,620
others web service who knows what you

00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,570
can do with it but once it's

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,180
configurable we could do whatever we

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,220
pleased with it and we already had the

00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,160
biggest step done when we formalize the

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,990
meta api so a lots changed since you may

00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,190
have looked it in the past if you're

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:09,850
curious come and talk to me i'll be

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:21,780
doing some of this at the sprints thank

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:21,780
you Sam all right next up is Greg Turner

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:58,460
this thing whoops no do you not I think

00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,500
I thought it for me well

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,210
I'm how about i just press all the

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,730
buttons on my laptops and then hopefully

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:08,600
so I'm just going to do it this way and

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,490
look up there my name is Greg I'm here

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,920
as a representative of the Django Code

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,450
of Conduct committee and I'm also a code

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,090
of conduct representative for this

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,260
conference over the next few days I

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:25,820
wanted to tell you about a thing that

00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:30,230
we've done recently so oops there's a

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:32,090
page on the Django site about the code

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,060
of conduct it describes why we need one

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,320
which I'm not going to repeat here and

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,900
then how to make a report and then what

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,600
we do when we get a report now this this

00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,040
is working pretty well in practice in

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,990
terms of helping to make the community

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,080
bit by bit a better place and a fairer

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:55,100
kind of representative representation of

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,660
the world as a whole we've still got a

00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,060
long way to go one of the problems

00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,230
though that we've come up against is

00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,410
that is kind of this page as like laden

00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:11,480
with terms about like enforcement and

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:13,490
like how how we moderate the community

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,830
in response to reports and that's kind

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:19,960
of confronting and scary to a lot of

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,800
people in the community who are

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,140
concerned about the amounts of

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,850
accountability we have and like how they

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,680
know what's going on and we've got the

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,200
converse problem which is that we can't

00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,120
we often what we're dealing with is very

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,540
confidential in nature and we can't say

00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:38,240
very much about it so so the upshot is

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:42,830
that a lot of people who object to

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,260
having codes of conduct on the basis of

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,380
worried about the accountability of all

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:53,330
people that what we as the committee

00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:55,240
decide well okay so let me do that

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:58,220
sentence again a lot of people object to

00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,140
codes of conduct worry about the

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,480
accountability and so we wanted to

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,890
respond to that without compromising in

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,210
any way the integrity of our

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,860
investigations so we decided to kind of

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,720
write down what we did and be

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,109
transparent about it

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:18,170
so we've created this space django

00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:21,170
github / django / code of conduct which

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,540
is basically our operating manual and it

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:28,130
tells it tells us how to make decisions

00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:30,790
based on kind of examples of situations

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,340
that occur and how we dealt with them

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,890
we've opens we've open sourced it not

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,530
only so that people in our community can

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,680
kind of contribute and and you know kind

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:47,240
of pressure test it but also because

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,420
django as a whole is leading the way in

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:57,830
terms of how open-source manages its

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:59,630
code of conduct issues and there's a lot

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,010
of unanswered questions in the world as

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,260
a whole and we want to share our

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,820
approaches to answering those questions

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,990
with other people in other communities

00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:10,820
and this is our way of doing it so

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,830
please if you're engaged and you care

00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,380
about Django because the quality of

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,230
Jango's a community check this out have

00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,510
a read through tease away at the edge

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:24,020
cases ask questions raised issues and

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:34,190
let's let's make this a best place that

00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:36,260
we can make it thanks next up is jeremy

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,210
epstein I just say a very big thank you

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,440
to Gregg and Katie and everybody else

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,170
who's serving on the code of conduct

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,730
committee for an event like this I know

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,520
from experience that it so it can be a

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,960
very draining thing to take on and Gregg

00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,339
in particular from being involved with

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,940
the January code of conduct committee

00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:54,170
actually n amber as well for that matter

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,849
it's a it's an emotionally draining

00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,700
thing to be involved in you you have to

00:36:55,849 --> 00:37:00,530
deal with a lot of emails of things that

00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,480
you really not have to read about and

00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,859
try to work out how to judge someone

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,580
else's behavior under weird

00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:09,589
circumstances it's not pleasant so if

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,700
you do get opportunity I please go and

00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:11,930
thank them for the work they do because

00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,490
it's part of what makes this community

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,960
great and it's it's for the most part

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,339
thankless work because so much of it has

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,660
to be done in secret for the benefit of

00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,660
those reporting problems

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:36,359
yes mm-hmm and we're almost there oh

00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:48,910
wait cool have a good yep I think so all

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:53,619
right here we go here's Jeremy okay I'm

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:57,039
Jeremy and a few years ago I had a

00:37:53,619 --> 00:38:01,599
little problem with a web app we're

00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:05,200
collecting as you do postcodes from

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:09,089
users to work out there approximately

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,289
where they live in australia and the

00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:14,579
people were making this where they're

00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:17,769
poor also wanted to know the LGA the

00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:22,569
local government area of all their

00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:25,589
registered users turns out that there is

00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:29,739
actually no official authoritative

00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:33,849
mapping provided by any government or

00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:39,009
other group any nothing of LGA's to post

00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:41,789
codes in Australia so I had to use my

00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:45,789
own resourcefulness to make such a list

00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:49,539
so it's just a quick talk about what I

00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:53,880
did so first of all here is the list

00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:56,529
that I generated so you can grab it off

00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,210
Google formally google docs believe in

00:38:56,529 --> 00:39:04,170
our Google Drive so just simple list of

00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:07,869
the names of the regions and postcodes

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:10,329
covers everywhere in Australia that has

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:16,450
an LGA which is not everywhere in

00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:21,249
australia and oga is i discovered in

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:24,039
this very wildly as brisbane people may

00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:26,170
know i'm not a Brisbane person as

00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:29,319
Brisbane people may know all of Brisbane

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,089
City basically as 10 GA and all gold

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,559
coast as well but other places like

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:37,779
Sydney and Melbourne have

00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:43,749
numerous LGA's in the city so to do this

00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:47,380
I grabbed some geospatial datasets that

00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:50,349
you can get from our good friends at the

00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,180
australian bureau of statistics I've

00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:58,199
been doing such a fabulous job over the

00:39:52,180 --> 00:40:02,559
past week perfect they're their online

00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:04,329
catalog for geospatial datasets looks

00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,089
pretty just like all the rest of their

00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:09,189
web services and functions amazingly

00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:10,749
looks a little bit prettier than it did

00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:15,749
a few years ago and I looked at this

00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:19,689
last not much so basically i did was

00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:24,930
downloaded the shape files for LGA's and

00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:27,609
the shape files for post codes and just

00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:31,209
open up the blog post that I wrote about

00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:35,130
this at the time just used a

00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:38,799
command-line tool called ODI to 20 gr to

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:43,869
process the shape files and import them

00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:50,789
into postgres in to post GIS and then

00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:54,699
just did a really simple SQL post GIS

00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:57,160
intersects query on all the all the

00:40:54,699 --> 00:41:01,329
imported shape files and then just

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:04,949
export it out to a CSV and that CSV is

00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:09,099
basically this spreadsheet that you see

00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:12,519
so if you search for LGA postcode on

00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:15,369
Google we see that come up now above the

00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:20,789
abs data and although it's not that

00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:23,739
useful people asked about this on

00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:27,039
whirlpool quite a lot else that was

00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:29,529
where I first found people looking for

00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,329
this info and I asked here as well if

00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:36,939
anyone had anything better than what I'd

00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:39,999
done and the answer was not really so so

00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:45,429
yes just a quick shout out if anyone

00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:46,400
else needs this data here it is if you'd

00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:49,849
like to read

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,630
narrator when the ABS posts new updated

00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:54,940
chamber miles which will probably have

00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,190
to happen in the next year or two

00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:01,369
particularly the council amalgamations

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:06,020
that are happening in New South Wales so

00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:12,109
got all the little code snippets you'd

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:14,990
need to update the data set so say it

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:18,890
not not particularly specific to django

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:23,270
or even to python but did use this in a

00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:32,059
Python where about myself and yeah okay

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:33,980
find it useful alright that concludes

00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:35,210
our time for lightning talks amuse hang

00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,770
around for just a moment we do some

00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,150
final closing remarks and a little

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,680
special something just at the end

00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,230
because you've been such good people

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,640
hanging around all day so just give us

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:57,619
quite a moment while we hook up some

00:42:43,640 --> 00:43:04,059
laptops and things could Samuel Bishop

00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:05,809
come and get his lanyard and Greg Turner

00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:16,089
we're gonna auction them off to the

00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:16,089
hospital Samuel Bishop learn you know

00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:55,679

00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:58,769
scene all right okay are we good yep all

00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,049
right okay so sadly my friends this

00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:06,299
concludes Jack O'Connor Australia 2016

00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:08,640
oh that's like good response good so I

00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:10,170
would like to thank all the AV people

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:17,729
who have been running around doing

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:19,619
amazing work all day I'd like to thank

00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:21,059
Donna Benjamin who very kindly stepped

00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,439
in to do a keynote speech this morning

00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:28,439
did a fantastic job thankyouverymuch

00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:29,969
daughter thank you to all of the regular

00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:33,029
speeches speakers who went through the

00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:34,709
the call for papers process and as

00:44:33,029 --> 00:44:36,630
having someone who's now served on the

00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:38,880
code the call for papers or the paper

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,799
papers process board for the last couple

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,929
of years this year was was pretty brutal

00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:45,689
in terms of getting through so that the

00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:47,099
speakers that made it that's not saying

00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:48,479
anything bad about the people who didn't

00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,769
make it because the ones who made it was

00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:51,359
it was really hard to get in there this

00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:53,670
year it was a very hard job picking the

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,079
program and of course the Lightning

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,849
speakers without when we wouldn't have

00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,910
had this last little block of deeply

00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:04,769
entertaining schadenfreude in some cases

fundraising page Tim Graham in

00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,380
particular is our DSF fellow the reason

00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:50,490
that we have hit deadlines for releasing

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,230
19 1 10 18 actually on schedule is

00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,300
entirely due to Tim the fact that we

00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,010
have a regular stream of bugs being

00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,510
fixed and patters being merged is almost

00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,110
entirely because of him at the moment

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,970
and he's a woefully underpaid for the

00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,760
amount of work that he does so we would

00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:09,120
like to pay him a lot more so please

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,140

00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:15,600
was organized as a mini conference that

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,970
was so tied to the side of pike on as a

00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,920
result we don't have a budget but we do

00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,390
have the shirts so if you jump on there

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,370

00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:47,190

doing this for five years I've loved

00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,770

00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,450
person who either stand on this stage so

00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:31,190

tomorrow we are back for pike on

00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,640
australia i believe we kick start the

00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,370
doors open again at eight o'clock with a

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,780
program starting at nine o'clock

00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,380
obviously get here early because you

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,559
know coffee and cue

00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,299
and things there's also Django girls

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,609
there is no official Django girls event

00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:52,859
for plaque on Australia this year and

00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:56,039
just we just ran out of time to organize

00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:58,079
it but that doesn't mean that can't be

00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,089
Django girls events Django girls is a

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,880
fantastic way of getting people involved

00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:05,640
and so educating the broader community

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,039
and in broadening the diversifying the

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,259
the base of people who use Django I've

00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:11,609
meant ordered more Django girls in a

00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:13,140
chaotic out at this point and they're

00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:15,690
all it's a fantastic experience as a

00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,329
mentor and it's just great to sort of

00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,980
see a big broadening of the talent that

00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:21,720
can come in and use Django at the end of

00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,400
the day so if you are interested in

00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,920
organizing Django girls go hit Django

00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,569
girls that org and see how easy it is to

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,099
set up an event it basically comes down

00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:31,680
to find a venue find a bunch of people

00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,970
and then stand back as you get stampeded

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,349
by people who want to lose have learn

00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:40,589
how to use Django so go an investigate

00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:42,660
so there's no formal events planned for

00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:45,119
this evening but um you know we're all

00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,710
grown adults who can entertain ourselves

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,990
in various fashions so I'm sure there'll

00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,950
be something happening tonight so I'll

00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,809
see you tonight and I'll see you

00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,309
tomorrow I'll see you later this year

00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:56,269
and other events and I Django under the

00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:58,680
hood and what have you but i did say

00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:06,509
singing and dancing so now for something

00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:08,900
completely different just to wrap out

00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:08,900
the afternoon

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:24,810
I am the very model of a modern Django

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,760
model for my handle any language even

00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,560
emoji and cuneiform my data can be

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,540
accessed to an elegant and mature or

00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,790
manned rails pylons PHP they look upon

00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,140
me with forlorn some criticized the

00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,430
white space in my language with a lot of

00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,900
swan but when you were quite used to

00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,310
this you probably think this is the norm

00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,090
what building site probably end up

00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:43,350
writing lots and lots of views to

00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,180
service all the shopping carts and

00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,650
sometimes even read the news is all the

00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,600
jarring cuts is sometimes even read a

00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,570
mutes another time in person sometimes

00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:55,290
even read them sometimes even read the

00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:56,790
boring news your design assets will be

00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,320
safely stored out there and static files

00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,000
the pretty is completed by the use of

00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,320
prosodic ascending stars while I'm at

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,180
their handling all that emoji ain't

00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,390
uniform I'm still the very model of a

00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,030
modern Django model form and we'll do a

00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:12,710
form of your brain

00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:14,690
under both on my models can be entered

00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,160
into any modern database but really you

00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,720
should use postgres like anybody with

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,520
good taste atomic transactions could let

00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,840
me handle Fraley's with good grace i 18

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,020
n and Elton n mean I can run it any

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,520
place auto escaping by default help

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,960
stock with all the egg on face and

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,580
future errors are prevented with a

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,200
sturdy testing based but nothing can

00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:34,130
protect you from a dev offer was feeling

00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,530
SMO who edits in production and then

00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,750

engines last competitive about you then

00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,520
introduces as he loves evos and that's

00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,290
why your your site should have a

00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,910
comprehensive monitoring scheme alerting

00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,650
to activities of hackers who are being

00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,480

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,280
their emoji and cuneiform because i am

00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,819
