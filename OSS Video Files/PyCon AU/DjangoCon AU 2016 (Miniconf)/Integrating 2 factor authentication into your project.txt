Most websites these days require some kind of authentication. User name + password is the most common one. OAuth with Facebook / Github / Google / Twitter is also common. But sometimes you can't rely on 3rd party services and user name + password is not enough. In those cases 2 Factor Authentication is a nice, additional security layer. Use e.g. a phone to ensure a more secure authentication.
