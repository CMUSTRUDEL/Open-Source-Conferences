Title: Search-First Writing for Developers
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: DjangoCon AU 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Heidi Waterhouse
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/47/view_talk
If people can't use your software, you have already failed as a developer. 

This talk digs in to how optimizing for search and using the existing technical assistance forums can put your product ahead of the pack. Technical writing, in all its variations, is a type of interface with your product. It incorporates everything from an error message to an implementation guide. How can you as a developer make deploying, using, and promoting your product as painless as possible? Make it searchable. Make finding the answer to a problem so trivially easy that your user barely even remembers they had a problem.

No one wants to be using software. They want to be data mining or manipulating beautiful photos or targeting advertising. Making them think about the software diverts them from what they want to be accomplishing. Use these documentation techniques to get them in and out and on their way.

okay ladies and gentleman we get going

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,080
again our next speaker is Heidi

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,840
Waterhouse again an international

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,010
speaker who has come to us who is going

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,420
to be speaking about search first

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,960
writing for developers thank you very

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:23,039
much Heidi good morning I think I

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,019
started my day in Minneapolis so well

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,970
I'm not entirely sure what time it is

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,980
anymore and I've always wanted to tell

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:35,520
this joke so I just felt flew in from

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:37,079
the US and boy are my arms tired it's

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,750
not many times you get a chance to do

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,670
that so I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,070
about search first writing for

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,600
developers and this is a talk that I've

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,460
written specifically for developer

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,770
conferences because I'm a technical

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,059
writer and you all are not doing it

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,620
right sorry I don't mean to be judgey

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,800
but oh this is the end of my

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,300
presentation so I'm going to suavely a

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,539
skip through a whole bunch of slides

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,320
sorry that's what i get for duplicates

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:10,740
yeah there should be a start over

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,260
because I'm a dummy setting but look at

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,520
all these slides are you guys ready I

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:23,280
talk really fast so it's going to be

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:25,890
okay it's like a preview yeah exactly

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,990
it's the trailer so I have put on here a

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,610
hashtag if you guys are tweeting about

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,259
it I'd really appreciate you using the

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,659
hashtag it allows me to find it and

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,770
storify it later so that people can find

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,869
it and that's super useful all right so

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,549
now you're going to advance right when

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,560
we use software we are trying to

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,780
accomplish a goal it's not that we

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,450
actually enjoy using software we're just

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,290
trying to fix a problem or find an ATM

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,909
or catch a leafy on so if we're using

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,759
software we're not really thinking about

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,710
the software but that doesn't mean we

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,149
don't have feelings about it it's just

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,210
that frequently our feeling is like hmm

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,770
we don't really care once in a while

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,720
you'll meet software that makes you feel

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,740
like this like I feel like this reading

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,050
the slack of release notes they

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,250
light me they're just so charming but

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,790
most of the time you're not going to

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,360
feel like that about software mostly the

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,860
emotion that we noticed is like yeah oh

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,540
it's not letting me do what I want Excel

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,340
believes that's not a date but a number

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:36,750
whatever it is the emotion we noticed

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,910
most is this emotion this is how we feel

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,870
about software that blocks us from doing

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,850
what we want to do we are trying to do

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,640
something here people and your software

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,210
is getting in my way and why has it

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,010
crashed or why isn't it working here's

00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,020
my deep dark secret as a technical

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,180
writer nobody likes reading

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,040
documentation I don't like reading

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,870
documentation if I had wanted to read

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,390
documentation I would not have been a

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,920
technical writer who writes it see I

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,350
never have to read it because it doesn't

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,010
exist yet it's great it's totally a

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,890
feature but reading documentation

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,080
improves our skills and it's not

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,090
rewarding in the moment unlike a dog

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,370
that steals something off the counter

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,020
its immediately rewarded we are not

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,770
immediately rewarded for reading

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,580
documentation but it does teach us a lot

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,350
of important things sadly most of the

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,500
time when people come to documentation

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,020
they are already angry like this is my

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,760
secret as a technical writer anybody

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,310
who's reading documentation has already

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,300
failed at using the software and they

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,070
are already angry they are they are

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,480
looking for help because they were

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,690
trying to do a thing they were trying to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,090
catch their Leafeon or find an ATM or

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,300
munge their data and it's failed so

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,230
they're angry and you know what lots of

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,320
documentation is trying to be cute I

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,900
worked for the most boring software

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,320
company on earth we made a platform that

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,709
sat on top of IBM WebSphere MQ ended

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,410
message queue monitoring the software

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,290
was based on I kid you not sewage

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,470
monitoring like back in the dawn of time

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,180
it turns out that ques of messages and

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,430
queues of poop are essentially

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,260
indistinguishable if your software

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,590
this company had named their product q

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,720
pasa with a an exclamation mark that was

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,060
part of the branding and all of our

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,370
bullet points were adorable little chili

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,890
peppers in the five years I worked for

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,480
that company nobody I ever talked to was

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,430
termed by the Chili Peppers they were

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,510
mostly angry because they were using

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:53,280
software and reading documentation so

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:56,200
what makes reading documentation better

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,390
what makes it better is getting the

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,210
answer you need at the time you need it

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,580
so you can do your thing there's an art

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,930
to giving people that answer and i'm

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,130
going to teach it to you really fast

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,780
because i'm good at this about ten

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,120
percent of developers like writing

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,620
documentation they exist a large

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,140
percentage of them were German and I

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,800
don't understand why but if you've ever

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,450
worked with a German they're like

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,640
they're like meticulous documentaries I

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,150
don't like something about the school

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,220
system or something and this room is

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,720
going to be biased toward developers who

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,460
like writing documentation because you

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,330
didn't flee from the very title that

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,680
involved writing but only about ten

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,630
percent of developers like writing

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,180
documentation and here's why you should

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,880
do it it saves you from answering the

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:51,550
same question over and over and over and

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,230
over again which nobody loves the other

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,080
thing that saves you from is burnout I

00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:00,220
was talking to Eric hoelscher who runs

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,780
read the docs and a conference called

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,820
right the Ducks which I love girly but

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,610
read the docs is supporting some huge

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,250
players in open source and he's running

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,100
it single-handed because he can't find

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,860
enough money so every time he can

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,170
document something and take a support

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,270
burden off it makes it possible for him

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,100
to do more development on it I think you

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,270
should all give read the docs more money

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,270
but i also think

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,690
I also think you should think about how

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,460
every time you write documentation you

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:39,090
were saving yourself from burnout so how

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,330
to write documentation let me give you a

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,340
pitch first professionals get paid for

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,930
domain-specific knowledge there are

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,139
thousands of technical writers in the

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,180
world and even a few dozen as good as me

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,009
we can design your documents analyze

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,130
your audience use our special mystical

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:58,229
tech writing tools and turn out a shiny

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,580
professional set of documentation for

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,500
you in less time than you would believe

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,360
possible that make you look

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,780
enterprise-grade even if you're five

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,720
people in an incubator the best way to

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,389
get top-notch documentation is to hire

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,280
someone like me and not ways developer

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:20,550
time doing something that is not in

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,919
their domain experience but for most

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,389
technical writers the pay scale is about

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,030
the same as a Java developer of

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,510
equivalent experience like just you know

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,099
and even if we have to learn your

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,330
software it takes this much less time

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,780
because we don't have to learn how to

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,470
write English and I love you all but not

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,500
always your most most beautiful skill

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,659
but who can afford that right like can

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,909
you add another developer to your

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,669
project right now or somebody who cost

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:52,500
as much as a developer probably not lots

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,440
of you you're on small projects or

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,240
you're on love projects or you're in a

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,699
team that isn't structured to have a

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,080
full-time writer and probably you don't

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,900
have quite enough work for a full-time

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,210
writer so if you can't afford it here's

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,740
what we're going to do you're going to

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,949
have to write your own documentation or

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,180
get your developers to do it and I'm

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,280
going to tell you how to do it as

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,940
painlessly as possible which is not to

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,210
say no pain but suffering it's good for

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,810
the soul figure out what questions

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,909
people are actually asking you need to

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,919
think about what your users are asking

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:32,940
to understand and what is making them

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,070
make that angry emoticon if you don't

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,310
have users find some people who are like

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,650
your projected users and

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,170
set them up as target users if you don't

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,380
have a profile in persona for a target

00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:49,510
user stop writing documentation is not

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,820
your problem back up and figure out who

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,870
you're going to sell this to because

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,280
you've got bigger problems the

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,440
documentation if you don't know who your

00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:01,840
user is so ask your users what they're

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
trying to do with your software don't

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,260
assume that you know what they're trying

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,350
to do with your software because what a

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,270
developer does with their software is

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,710
almost entirely different than what a

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,960
user is going to do with the software

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,380
the Venn diagram overlap on that is

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,120
extremely small weirdly enough watch

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,220
them use your product and figure out

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,280
what they're struggling with and this

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:28,510
only works if you don't help them if you

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:31,360
find out where their pain points are if

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,620
your product is accessible somehow find

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,980
out where the users are talking to each

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:39,280
other I find it super useful to go to

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,080
stack overflow and find out what the

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,400
common questions are and whether or not

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,010
they've actually gotten answered and

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,200
then I steal those answers back there

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,020
might be an IRC channel there might be a

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,640
slack channel there might be a

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,890
well-traveled physical bulletin board in

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,690
the hallway where people post questions

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,400
and answers whatever it is you have to

00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,980
find out where the users are talking to

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,620
each other and collect those questions

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,460
and do a rough frequency analysis on it

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,620
so you know what's confusing people if

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,170
you have anyone doing support they are

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,510
also an invaluable resource they know

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,120
what they're answering all day get into

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:19,120
your support metrics and find out how

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,800
many times a day they are answering the

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,180
same question and use that as a

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,590
contribution to the stack of questions

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,450
that you're collating so hopefully you

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,950
have a huge list of questions now it

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,990
would like this stack of things that

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,120
people are confused by and you sort of

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,340
sorted them roughly into categories like

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,630
people are confused by onboarding people

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:47,290
are confused by configuration take it

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:51,610
down to 20 questions 20 questions if you

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,769
can answer 20 questions here's the deal

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,200
fun fact the normal distribution works

00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:57,970
on lots of things if you answer the 20

00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,620
questions out of a hundred confusing

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,260
things about your product you are

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,880
serving the vast majority of your users

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:09,279
the 8020 idea of centering your focus

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,519
not on the edge cases but on the most

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,440
common problems i think is nerds we have

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,410
a fascination with the long tail and the

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,450
edge case and the weird outside things

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:24,510
but that's not actually helping people

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:27,130
who need to use your stuff so analytics

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,380
stop and set up analytics on whatever

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,690
you're doing you want to be able to see

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,149
where people are going what they're

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,209
asking and how often they're getting

00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,529
their questions answered so right now

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,640
you're just going to set it up it's just

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,540
going to sit there for a little bit

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,940
we'll talk about part two in a minute

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,860
now you have 20 questions answer those

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,560
questions in a way that people can find

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,899
and use you have to answer the actual

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,850
question that they're asking as it

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,709
affects function and not the way they

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,140
ask it because if you've ever worked

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,750
support you're painfully aware that the

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,160
way a user asks the question and the way

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,699
you're going to be able to answer it or

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,360
sometimes widely divergent it doesn't

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:12,250
hurt to do both to to use the language

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,440
that someone is used to ask the question

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:19,690
and answer it in your language but you

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,540
can't do only one next you need to make

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,890
your answers findable one of the things

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,839
I've learned over the years is that what

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,810
your users call something and what you

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,850
call something is widely divergent but

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,079
if you want to serve them you're going

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:39,370
to have to use the terms that they're

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:41,290
using who recognizes this mm-hmm for

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,180
years Microsoft would give you this

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,670
error when you had her the screen when

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,290
you had a fatal error everyone who

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,550
worked with windows recognized it and

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,110
knew what was happening and we all

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,079
called it the blue screen of death but

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:58,300
when you searched on Microsoft's help

00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,819
there was no blue screen of death entry

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,270
it didn't tell you what you were looking

00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:05,500
at they've added it now it's now a

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,180
searchable term

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,770
if you search on blue screen of death it

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,170
will take you to the fatal error page

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,000
but for years that wasn't true and so

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,380
you'd hit this thing and your

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,700
administrator would go oh yeah you've

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,040
got a blue screen of death and you go

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,830
look up blue screen of death and

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,840
Microsoft wouldn't give you the answer

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,370
that's not very helpful so figure out

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,650
what your users are calling it if they

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,840
call it a spinning beachball or a glitch

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,330
instead of a bug or a blue screen of

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,850
death whatever they're calling it you

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:38,110
have to have that in your index term so

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:42,310
they can find it I once spent a whole

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,620
summer in 1995 adding metatext to a

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,510
bunch of pages so that we could sort of

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,130
fuzz the search engines and get more

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:52,300
hits than we legitimately deserved

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,610
anybody ever had that job it's a

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,140
terrible job it was it was miserable but

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,690
it turns out if you're actually

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,480
providing value by putting in extra

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,360
terms that are useful to your users it's

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,540
a totally ethical and useful way to get

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,420
people to your site the thing is the

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,240
search engines know when you're being

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,300
deceptive about it so if it's not a real

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,630
term don't put it on your page so

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,270
analytics part 2 I use google analytics

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,370
on my site and I don't have a very

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,680
heavily configured because all I want to

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,050
know is what device are you reading this

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,100
on like do I need to optimize for phone

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:36,160
yes I do what are you reading what

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,480
things should I write more of like my

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,700
most popular blog post right now is a

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,860
summary of how women's speakers need to

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,990
think about clothing because being up on

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:51,460
stage with fewer pockets is an actual

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,980
problem and why are people bouncing is

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,480
it not giving them the answer that they

00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,420
want or is it maybe not so there's the

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,920
page broken is there bad to advertising

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,050
these are all actionable things I'm not

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,530
monetizing my blog but I need to know

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,870
these things so I can make it better so

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,089
so many times search engine optimization

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,070
feels like a scam and a problem but it

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,160
doesn't have to be in an ideal world

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,750
it's like super sophisticated indexing I

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,020
have a

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,000
whole like mini talk on indexing and I

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,300
don't have time to get into it now but

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,130
it's really important so here's the

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,670
problem search phrase here's what

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,230
somebody enters in a in a search engine

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,370
my wallet doesn't fit in my bike shorts

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,020
and right now your site says Road ID

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,720
identification tags dog tags emergency

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,480
you'll notice that there's no overlap

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,640
between those so what you have to do is

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,770
say why are people searching for well it

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,100
doesn't fit in my bike shorts well it's

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,380
because if I end up as Road pizza I want

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,580
somebody to be able to call my next of

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:04,220
kin and find out what my blood type is

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,560
so if you add wallet biking sailing

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,540
sports spandex and reflective you're

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,340
going to catch a bigger percentage of

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,830
the people who have the problem that you

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,930
are actually solving Road ID is a real

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,190
product I think it's awesome that that

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:23,150
they have done this and they're really

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:26,370
findable all right hands up if you can

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:31,070
good morning put your hands up all right

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:35,190
who loves the giant unordered faq what

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:37,680
amazing who believes that the things in

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,750
and a faq are actually frequently asked

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,550
questions huh who searches inside a faq

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,010
page in the vain hope that eventually

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,370
they will find it answer because it

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,800
might be there yeah right the FAQ page

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,630
is a cop-out I know sometimes you need

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,730
it but you should know that you are

00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,530
wasting an opportunity to give people a

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,940
clue about how to use and understand

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:04,949
their software group your answers in a

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,670
way that makes it possible for people to

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:10,140
find things by serendipity too if one

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,579
thing doesn't work maybe the next thing

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,520
on the list is what they're looking for

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,970
like say I type Dvorak because I'm were

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,030
weirdo say I'm looking for language

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,949
keyboard options right I'm like where's

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,860
my language option how do i set my

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,630
keyboard to this well language doesn't

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,760
have it but what if keyboard

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,289
localization is the next answer on the

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,419
list oh I

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:39,279
suddenly I'm less angry less frowny face

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:41,500
that's the goal so I've told you that

00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,640
you need to write things and I have told

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,100
you how you're going to get people to

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,559
find them but I think I should probably

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,630
cover how do you actually write a thing

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:54,789
right and because this is after 2000

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,409
which is roughly the breakpoint we're

00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:59,500
going to talk about task-based writing

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:04,960
which is to say instructions on how to

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,940
do one thing establish where you are if

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,809
somebody has come to you through search

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,640
every pages page one so you need to tell

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,230
them where they are before you can tell

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,299
them where they're going if they're in

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,409
configuration they need to know that if

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:23,830
they're in extra arcane weird steps they

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:25,870
need to know that it sounds silly to say

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,450
here's where you are at the start of

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,159
every topic if you are writing them all

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,669
at once but if you're reading them one

00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,270
at a time it's totally important who

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:39,760
knows carmen sandiego oh good so

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:45,970
sometimes I'm like oh you you sweet

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,710
young things so an example page might

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,380
say follow these steps after you

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,330
complete their prerequisites you need to

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,799
have a link back to the prerequisites

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,899
page because people need to have

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,039
completed that so when you were playing

00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:01,000
where in the world is carmen sandiego

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,890
you could only find her if you knew if

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,539
you had followed all the other steps to

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:09,580
get there you couldn't just happen upon

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:11,919
her so give orders technically this is

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,480
the imperative voice I think I didn't

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,880
have time to look this up it's also the

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,750
second person implied object but you

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,610
know what grammar doesn't matter what

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,090
matters is stripping all the politeness

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,970
and ambiguity out makes it easier to do

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:31,750
the thing right now so if I say raise

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,870
your hand it's more compelling than if I

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,299
say please lift your hand in the air

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:39,490
it's just like there's a processing

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,590
delay there and you need to think about

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,510
that so don't be like you know you're

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,059
not polite and technical red and you are

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,130
clear

00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:52,059
so how does a user know if they got a

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:55,360
task right right a unit test if you

00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:57,970
can't say at the end of the five or six

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,230
steps that you've written test this by

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:04,230
running or you should see or something

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,700
that tells the user they got it right

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,610
you're in big trouble because you don't

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,940
have a task you have a part of a task or

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,820
a task and a half or possibly you have

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,610
like some steps that are unrelated to

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,890
anything getting done but if you can't

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:25,570
write a teske get a test against it it's

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,550
not a task so every task you write

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,010
should be testable if you can't think of

00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,320
a test it's not a task it's easy to take

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,450
things apart but it's harder to tell if

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,660
you put them back together correctly if

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,860
you disassemble a Rubik's Cube and don't

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,510
put it back together right you will

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:45,700
never be able to fix it FYI so what's

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,100
next once you've added turned someone's

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,540
question that's great but this is your

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,670
one chance to help them a little bit

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,650
more if your answer is related to

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,590
another step put a link to the next step

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,990
at the bottom so you say great you've

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,660
configured your email settings click

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,730
here to go to two-factor authentication

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,210
you're giving them a path through a

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,160
guide to the flow of your document or

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,630
your software you've left them some

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,590
bread crumbs that they can choose to

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,790
follow or not so the most important part

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,650
of giving people information is

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,020
remembering that they're using it to get

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,970
something done not that they want to be

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,820
good not that they want to be reading it

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:28,179
so get out of the way there are a lot

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,190
more users than there are of you do

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,320
everything that they that you can to let

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,070
them on their experience this is just

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:42,820
for Australia I saw sheep coming into

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:44,380
the airport oh oh my gosh she um we have

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,349
sheep in America too but it's less

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,649
exciting

00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:53,049
so give the people what they need when

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:55,059
they need it tell them how they know it

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,849
worked and tell them what to do next

00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:01,719
that's all you need to be doing for good

00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:04,109
documentation so if this was too long

00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:06,909
for you and your red Twitter instead

00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:09,309
answer actual user questions not the

00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:12,849
ones who made up on your own as simply

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:16,779
as you can make it easy to find the

00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:18,820
answers all right what's my time do I

00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:28,149
have five minutes okay I have a I have a

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:29,469
video rant I hey oh sorry so there are

00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:31,570
lots of ways people like to consume

00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:33,009
information I have personally learned a

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,070
lot of sewing techniques from watching

00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:37,599
on YouTube but you need to calculate how

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,299
much it's going to cost you to keep it

00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,059
updated text your store and get is very

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:45,099
cheap to host and to change and video

00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:47,739
requires much more time and attention to

00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:49,599
alter an update all of us are more

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:51,399
likely to change something that feels

00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,729
unfinished than something that feels

00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:57,309
polished and if you want people to keep

00:22:54,729 --> 00:23:00,249
updating something you have to make it

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,460
not look perfect this is why i use

00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:06,399
sketchy markup when i'm doing things

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,789
that are designed related I really like

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:15,729
gorilla for using for documentation it's

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:19,059
brand new markup II language and it lets

00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:21,339
you pull things in and out of books and

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,200
create them very simply and it doesn't

00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:25,059
feel incredibly polished and like

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,249
developers are never allowed to touch

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:32,469
this so books that informed this talk

00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:34,059
Kathy seer is badass making users

00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:36,039
awesome i think somebody already tweeted

00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:39,549
about this today because it's that good

00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,769
every page is page one scott McLeod's

00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:43,330
understanding comics which is just core

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:49,359
to understanding the whole nature of the

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:51,659
web and the art of indexing get your

00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,659
pictures

00:23:51,920 --> 00:24:06,810
and video pic of video credits and there

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:07,890
we go thank you you can find me later in

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,330
the conference I think we're pretty much

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,290
we have nothing we actually do have for

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,720
about five minutes for questions if

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,730
they're your Argan yes question yes I am

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,860
the pink haired Mohawk person who is not

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,980
Sam so you can you can track me down

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,420
that way narrows it down why not we'll

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,430
just does is just to get the floor

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,420
started there's a fine line between

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,700
being direct and being rude how do you

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,020
balance that like what if I mean see

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,420
it's sort of an open-ended question but

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,740
how do you balance that space between

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,650
telling someone to do something and

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,360
being direct and being interpreted as

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,470
being rude and therefore not welcoming

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,630
ah so how do you balance between being

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,110
direct and seeming rude or abrupt or

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,030
Kurt the thing is rude which is

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,860
different than Kurt actually takes more

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,780
words if you're calling someone names or

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,310
implying that there an idiot it takes

00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,590
longer than just telling them how to do

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,170
something so if you find yourself like

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,130
adding anything about how somebody's an

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:10,170
idiot that's definitely rude the problem

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,570
with being Curt is that you want the

00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,930
instructions part like anything that has

00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:18,780
a number to be very clear but you can

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,940
put some sort of fluffy softening around

00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,110
it like the introduction now we're going

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,300
to learn how to if you have new users

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,550
which probably as developers you're not

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,160
writing for like super end end users but

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,080
if you are you can put a like a friendly

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,740
introduction into your steps but the

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,550
steps should stay very clean and clear

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,870
that make sense um quick one what was

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,660
the name of the mock-up language you

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,780
mentioned oh the Markov line i'm using

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,080
Bassam 'ok which is a tool that lets you

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,810
do like sketchy layouts by dragging them

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,250
and it looks hand-drawn so people will

00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,500
actually comment on it in a way that

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:02,580
they won't virgin gorilla I think

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,410
gorilla is a technical writing tool that

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,110
it's actually

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,090
a couple Australians founded it and went

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:15,810
and did an incubator in france and i

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:18,600
love the future and you can see Oh ril

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:22,530
la and you can search on it and they're

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,940
out now after a long time in beta and

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:28,680
you should go take a look at it it's

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:31,200
pretty cool hi if you're constantly

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,630
adding and polishing to your dogs how do

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,400
you work out what to cut if you are

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,130
constantly adding and publishing ducks

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,720
how do you figure out what the cut I

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,360
think everything should have an

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,810
expiration date I really want someone to

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,670
write me a wiki modifier that fades

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,690
things out if they're over a year old

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,970
and like if it should expire I have a

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,710
whole talk on how data should expire and

00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:00,650
data should die and we should stop

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:03,960
storing it and how like we're just

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:06,210
compulsively hoarding data and so I

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,590
think what should happen is when

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,390
something is over a year old you should

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,820
have a programmatic trigger that says

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,450
this topic is a year old is it still

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,950
correct or should I kill it and I think

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,450
that as programmers you guys could

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,850
probably figure out how to do that I

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,230
haven't I haven't yet and it's a good

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,060
thing we've got Sprint's coming up and

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,330
on Monday and Tuesday so it's just you

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,070
know hypothetically yes thanks for the

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,410
talk what do you think about getting

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,530
first-time users for an open source

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,810
project or comfort for example Django

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:39,870
involved in writing or rewriting

00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:43,080
existing documentation so it's more or

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,180
better understandable for beginners that

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,030
just discovered this new feature as

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,450
opposed to the developer who came up

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,370
with this feature right so it's really

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,290
important if you have somebody who's

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:59,250
willing to volunteer to be able to point

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:01,650
them at the project clearly so what you

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,230
need to do is write a story just like

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:08,400
agile development stories that say as a

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:11,370
user I want to understand how to use the

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,010
flip feature and then you can hand it

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:17,700
off to a relatively new person in the

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,119
community and they can like take in

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,349
enough

00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:24,949
information but you're still answering

00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:27,269
one question how do i use flip like

00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:29,099
hello think you've talked do you have

00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:30,659
any advice for developers who love

00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,889
writing documentation and want to get

00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:36,139
more into writing technical

00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:36,139
documentation to come to the dark side

00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,879
if you were a developer who really loves

00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:44,489
writing documentation I think that you

00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:46,949
have a lot of opportunities and the

00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:49,589
sneakiest way to do it i've seen is to

00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:51,839
go in through the API section and say oh

00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:53,399
I'm going to write the API and also the

00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,139
documentation oh and I've written the

00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,519
documentation for the API so I'm going

00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,529
to do a bunch of stories about how you

00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,389
can use that and now that we've done a

00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,579
bunch of stories about that let's do

00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,619
some like installation stuff and like

00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:08,219
you could sort of expand your range that

00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:10,379
way you mentioned a bunch of other talks

00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:13,069
you've given I want to see all of them

00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:16,469
where are they they are on my website

00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:20,279
Heidi Waterhouse calm it's pretty pretty

00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:23,839
straightforward yes all right with that

00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,839
