Description: 
	I started a study group to go through Udacity's Programming 101 course which is taught using Python. As a Ruby on Rails developer, I had plenty to learn, but most of my experience can be abstracted for running any programming study group. This is an overview of my experiences about what worked, what didn't, and if I'd do it again (spoiler alert: I've got one going already!). I learned a lot from it and want to share some of those lessons as well as encourage others to start something similar.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
