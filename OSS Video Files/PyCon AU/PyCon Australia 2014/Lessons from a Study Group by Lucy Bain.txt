Title: Lessons from a Study Group by Lucy Bain
Publication date: 2014-08-18
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	I started a study group to go through Udacity's Programming 101 course which is taught using Python. As a Ruby on Rails developer, I had plenty to learn, but most of my experience can be abstracted for running any programming study group. This is an overview of my experiences about what worked, what didn't, and if I'd do it again (spoiler alert: I've got one going already!). I learned a lot from it and want to share some of those lessons as well as encourage others to start something similar.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,660
so just a little bit about our knowledge

00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,240
at the beginning of the year we've seen

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,619
put together a pilot study group and it

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,430
was one of the best things I have ever

00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,860
attended to focus with you we are going

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,960
to share with you today our journey of

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,490
the staff room if you guys are

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,670
interested in giving back to the

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,310
community or teaching or learning this

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,289
one is definitely for you during the

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,390
study group we found some things and

00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:37,700
some approaches that worked really

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,220
really well and others that thought

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,750
quite visibly so we hope that you will

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,829
take away our knowledge and our

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,450
experience and build on it in the future

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,520
both in some benefits of a separate

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,510
business library chillier and I think

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,010
often I hope help along the way I was

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,160
going to program and I wanted to get

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:03,140
back with unity wonderful school of this

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,969
loader actually developer hurry so the

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,219
permit greedy community have helped a

00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,280
lot of the true programming events we

00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:10,960
have rails girls installed past

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,670
development clubs

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
just a few different events to let

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,990
people get started with the programming

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,460
and ask questions along the way these

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,610
events are awesome and I'm really

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,890
grateful to the community together but

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,840
there are also pretty copy and paste

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,960
tutorials and that's true for many

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,119
tutorials online so I was tired of

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,740
people missing the line of theirs just

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,080
to put it on and just getting totally

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,229
stocked they didn't understand some of

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,580
the concepts behind it they just threw

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,649
hoping that I could work out so I want

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,570
to run an introductory programming study

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:49,060
group just tell play some foundations

00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,950
and answer questions of making up I

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,830
would absolutely right an event like

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:57,009
this again as a ruby developer and I got

00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,170
my Java Python but it also moves so much

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,899
more than just programming I ask me

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,880
awesome people with Nadia I worked in my

00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,259
own organization skills and I've have to

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,539
sell the speaking is something I'm

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,030
always using now it was a great reminder

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,160
to see how far I've come since I started

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,290
programming and a reminder about how

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
difficult program can be when you just

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,700
started out it was encouraging to see

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,100
people who are just getting started how

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,930
much passion they have for it sometimes

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,000
you have to forget it's really rewarding

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,750
experience and I hope that you will do

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,390
it yourself so as many of you see no

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,610
learning how to program can be extremely

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,410
difficult because of the fire slick

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,150
motivation and persistence

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,670
but it also requires motivation and

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,980
persistence at all times even when a

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,140
stupid shampoo code is refusing to work

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,090
for you the special later and you can

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,340
knock back a lot like programming is

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,110
like you take two steps forward and it

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,330
just knocks you back some kind of way

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,120
and while there are so many resources

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,010
out there tutorials books websites can

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,170
be quite overwhelming intimidating

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,570
because they are yeah they do sometimes

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,970
take on a really big topic and let's

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,910
type of dog it's a great resource if

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,470
you've been around for a little while if

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,100
you better looking you know how to

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,470
navigate sango book but when i asked my

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,780
first question on Stack Overflow so we

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,300
asked me like a technical question back

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,640
to clarify mine and couldn't answer

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,980
about what the whole thing like went

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,750
unanswered and I was too scared to back

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,620
it again in case of more technical

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:33,010
questions piled on the original one I

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,870
think with several flow as well the time

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,550
too late to be trying to ask the

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,890
question and the time you get response

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,680
is quite a while sometimes it's ours

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,110
weeks months and by then you have moved

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,080
on from the project and you probably now

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,700
miss out

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,250
a little bit of information that you

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,680
need to know if the question get dance

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,740
at all I've said my fat ones but never

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,930
got them yeah and so studies have found

00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,670
that people do usually work better in

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,430
groups because it helps to solidify

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,950
concepts and it increases engagement

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,350
because you have to be you have to

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,290
communicate personnel next to your with

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:12,170
people are in the room that that says

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,660
well hey programming is great because it

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,269
gives the students better I guess

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,700
problem-solving skills and they face a

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,590
lot less anxiety when they have a harder

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,050
to hold a hand we go through the

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,390
question together and the best thing

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,190
about learning person to person is you

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,290
don't understand something someone can

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,090
draw a break now step by step you know

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,860
circle things right things draw things

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,350
which is something that you luck I guess

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,050
sometimes in the virtual world and it

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,840
really helps those that are visual

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,580
learners to because what I'm about

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,690
creative feeling something at

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:53,390
so just a little bit about attitude

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,460
breakfast was called you nasty they have

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,800
video lectures and that helps visual

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,660
learning that i mentioned earlier it's

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,820
also has questions throughout just

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,290
filled by multiple choice or fill the

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,550
blanks something to make sure that

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,240
you're paying attention and different

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,370
maybe walk away and the lectures are

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,500
there's about five to ten or more phones

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,680
some of them have answers we provide and

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,850
some of em are just left up to the user

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,290
so those are quite right because they

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,480
kind of encourage you to venture out

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:24,080
with me just being a little bit dear

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,330
eastern side however Udacity doesn't

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,090
have one big overarching project they

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,470
kind of work towards the end since we

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,180
haven't finished our study group they

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,650
have introduced this and I think it's

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,010
great because it keeps you motivated

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,720
because you want to finish it once you

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,850
build something and have something to

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,060
show up to the world of all you like

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,250
show all you found parking skills yes

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,230
they also focus just on computer science

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,900
it was going back to the basics it

00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,930
wasn't flashy you kind of websites or

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,580
anything but just going back for human

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,160
concepts and making sure you really

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,120
understand them it was also three which

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,910
is something I like to keep it

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,389
people in kirkwood be dancing has no

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,490
guess schedule or street two dates which

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,650
means you can view the course at your

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,500
own pace oh really good thing I'm really

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,240
bad thing because I should join the

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,850
course of my own before I join the study

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,370
room because it I never felt like the

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,380
emergency opt done it just got left

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,400
behind in my life day to day tivities

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,530
pain sort of double wow what a great

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,540
thing though is that it doesn t so

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,910
everything is done straight out of the

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,640
browser that means you tell me to

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,070
download anything talking to install

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,080
anything and I just remember i first

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,840
read out is like the tutorial start with

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,110
type this into the terminal I can I know

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,880
and rock beetles and everything is of

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,410
the browser it's safe to be a lot of

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,120
time that we didn't need to mess with

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,910
having different operating systems and

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,270
my fellows and fiber behind change

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,300
things a lot simpler yes II wasn't

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,220
Python so

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,750
that's what we're working with and of

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,539
course it has a lot of amazing large

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,120
program resources so you obviously

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,949
already know about those I choose white

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,020
one because I will join something as

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,000
well it's a ruby developer that's what I

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,310
do all day at work but I wanted to go

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,289
home and try something out see what else

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,419
is out there it was similar enough to

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,830
review that I could still be helpful but

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,900
different that I could learn something

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,740
and of course kylo has fantastic

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,870
occasion practices dreamy doesn't care I

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,460
will start working people it'll we're

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,159
just starting out and they didn't get

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,780
how about public readability so work

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,449
with Python and just be like no you

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,580
gotta do it Claire I always hear like

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,680
nightmare stories about like teachers at

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,560
universities like marking code and it's

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,900
just like this one like 3000 one with no

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,289
invitations because of invitations are

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,979
teachers good the course was also free

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:59,219
but only kind of I charge ten dollars

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,229
per meeting vessel fist so to do this I

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,819
have left my camp beginning as though

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,770
you were going to miss everything and

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,229
then the Ndege t playback of meetings

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,969
you had attended any money that's left

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,819
over was distributed to people who have

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,210
come to all of the meetings so this is

00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,580
far from gym

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,900
so our behavioral econ students it

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,139
wasn't my idea but I thought it was a

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,789
nice way to encourage you to attend I

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,130
thought it was very motivated to have a

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,289
monetary incentive to keep you attending

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,199
it was like the best beauty box I'd

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:31,479
never expect because you can know that

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,130
you cared about attending it but not so

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,409
much that he cried over it where it was

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,200
just too expensive in first place me to

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,330
pay and because i attended all the

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,190
meetings i am getting a bit of extra

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,649
cash in the end zone it was like I got

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,649
paid to attend to study it wasn't a lot

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,760
lessons that I learned God is going to

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,190
do this they're not really about

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,830
programming or just about study groups

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,200
at programming one particular they're

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,959
really languages in a minute so if you

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,180
don't I thought that you go do all that

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,220
work your won't try something else and

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,070
see how you go and then suddenly what a

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:17,370
JavaScript right now so these lessons

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:21,640
are were you if you do run

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:24,279
a big one for me was to manage

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,200
expectations as my invention there's no

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,089
final product to point you and I think

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,440
probably people thought the day end up

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,450
at something maybe at least show their

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,890
long I just like this is a bit of the

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,959
internet that I a happen but that wasn't

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,490
there I should have made that more clear

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,800
you're also not going to get a job that

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,860
I do this not from Earth food camp it's

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,940
not anything super intense it's just or

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,550
101 course and therefore basics I think

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,079
some of the people that had done started

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,329
with us have continuous learning how to

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,860
program and I think to the program

00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,510
Khatami's like chain programming jobs

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,769
that was like that was really good to

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,690
see that polluted adults and what dusty

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,550
it's advertised and let me it is

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,640
foursquare no prior programming

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,140
experience required public this was

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,490
definitely not the case tessie's

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,920
especially expect from like the really

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,839
well seasoned mature computer scientist

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,310
to build computers have you completely

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
forgotten how hard it was to get

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,410
together the first place the course is

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,170
offering you be a professor it's sort of

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,970
web board up is one-on-one course but

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,110
clean they had to convention just a bit

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,529
the time frame it was really challenging

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,600
it was

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,029
first class that they have offered so

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,069
since then now with all the courses that

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,019
are built now they have improved upon a

00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:47,300
bit have aced the course a little bit

00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,249
better and for the course that they

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,230
currently do have on there they have

00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,600
added lessons between the lessons that

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,240
have previously to try and fluid and all

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,649
the traps because sometimes it didn't I

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,670
run over someplace a little bit too

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:04,399
quickly i use pair programming at work

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,370
and I awesome I think it's really great

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,709
way to share knowledge and bounce ideas

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,290
off each other and for supervised things

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:15,050
so I was like oh doing introductory

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,699
course this is going to be great it

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,920
doesn't believe it takes as much I

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,410
thought that people would go home watch

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,209
the lectures come in and sit finally in

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,790
their hair answer things as they went to

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:29,600
law it's going to be very simple but

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,850
this didn't work yeah so because pant

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,490
broken up I think that was my grasp and

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,370
programming failed so far was just

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,829
because Penn programming picking

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,470
requires like a certain level of

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,839
familiarity with both the material and

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,970
person you're working with and it just

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,889
wasn't available on our first meeting

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,589
because the people that had come to this

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,480
gender had come from almost applying all

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,029
sorts of professions and they came from

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,610
all varying levels of to programming

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,620
knowledge since it failed so far that

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,629
first time I was really scared off when

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,759
I didn't bring it up again I think the

00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,889
pair programming would be really great

00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,230
and of course like this but maybe like a

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,230
few left of men and just not France

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,149
beginning since pair programming didn't

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,339
work out we all look through the problem

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,439
as a proof we could have just sort of

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,189
split up and from SAT there on one or

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:23,420
individually and ask questions as a mom

00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:26,209
but I thought that working as a group

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,980
was sort of simulate I need to put

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,889
things into words of her programming has

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,800
without it being like quiet intense as

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,329
pair programming kids and just force you

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,149
to other sandwich concepts you are

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:40,639
missing I was for me rather were

00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,649
incredibly lucky because people don't we

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,470
ended up how that the meetings were very

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,600
supportive and amazing it was nice

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,300
because like sometimes it muster up that

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,370
gold is bravery to ask this question I

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,770
thought was really stupid

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,230
let's see my people the rooms not alone

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,660
that I was like I just needed I wasn't

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,779
as alone as I felt like I was all time

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,190
and when i attended a study group I

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,710
could just throw a question out there

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,930
and then we just have like six or seven

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,020
wise and chuckie guys going taking that

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,210
way and although a person might not be

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,400
able to answer the question it might

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,890
start which might spark an idea someone

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,860
else is fine and they will take whatever

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,810
that's given will build on it and so

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,230
forth to will come up with the right

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,089
answer sounds really good and I think

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,640
sometimes disappear as well when you

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,650
don't know all the capabilities of the

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,390
language of programming or when you

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,790
don't know the terminology sometimes

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,770
it's very hard to price together in

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,020
questions so you know our face-to-face

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,500
you can kind of like interests your way

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,600
to the question if you're trying to ask

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,339
there's also red hope because even Lucy

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,550
sometimes would say I don't know to a

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,310
question and just to see a professional

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,380
programmer say that it just made

00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,110
programming so much more approachable

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,000
and it feels like an environment where

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,029
it could ask many questions as you need

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,029
it

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,070
for me a really big

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,070
I

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,360
but totally inaccurate huh we try that

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,819
at first and then it turned out that we

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,069
would meet twice per lesson to go home

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:28,259
watch the video lectures and come in and

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:31,740
just discuss all of the topics that

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,689
engines quite understand then you could

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,120
go home and do the homework problems or

00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:38,220
at least try to and again with me and go

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,149
through those answers answering

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,310
questions on calm so as she said that we

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,019
expected the course to take all this

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,230
time I was very encouraging because

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,149
people continue to the tent and I think

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,490
another reason why are starting group to

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,740
a little bit lower was about halfway

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,290
through he was we decided to take a

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,500
lesson to out and learn how to use git

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,389
and github which was great because get

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,459
help knowing how to use github again is

00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,959
a great skill obviously it's applicable

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,769
anywhere and it was one that I

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,719
computerized straightaway

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,179
udacity is also realizing just how long

00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:17,699
this tastes when I originally put the

00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,559
course it was back in February they have

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,649
time to do a take about six weeks to get

00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,329
girl I April they said two months by

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,729
June when we were fishing updates at

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:30,029
three months and in a spigot to take

00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:32,279
about 75 hours so even if you don't use

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,139
Udacity to do red group it's just really

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,499
important to think about how challenging

00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:39,749
programming can be how long you would

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:41,699
expect it to be just double it and build

00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:43,559
back into the schedule and certainly

00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,139
lovable have a time to answer fan

00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,819
questions listed and sometimes my

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,559
certain concepts will take a lot longer

00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,809
than others can you definitely want to

00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:56,489
accommodate those and let those concepts

00:15:51,809 --> 00:16:00,389
inc so in terms of organization of the

00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:02,249
group we Lucy said talk to me Elsa p1

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,949
systematically being to imagine turn up

00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:07,399
and another one after the meeting that

00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,869
this one was very important because

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,999
clarified what was expected of me before

00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,279
to go to the next trip just to make sure

00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:16,049
to get work done so that when you do

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,720
that precious time to get off together

00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,639
is maximized don't need to try catch up

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,339
you just want to be attractive that

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,980
great and for the study group we met

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,629
parts of me and I think what meeting

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,060
once a week is really good as well

00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,759
because it slips into weekly schedule

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,930
it's really easy to attend as opposed to

00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,509
say like fortnightly monthly meetings

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:41,970
pekingese because we didn't mean one we

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:44,399
just the way schedules worked out and we

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,019
wait less people the next week i will

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,029
really expecting us i think it's

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,160
important to have that consistency i

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,500
also think that the weekly games are

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,360
important just that how to question you

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,220
can answer reasonably quickly but it

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,649
don't mean events month within a sub

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,149
groups do and it was hold on we're

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,279
sitting on this one day that you didn't

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,699
understand progressions in this little

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,699
obviously

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,439
for me I have an emotional thing I

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,230
needed to do was expecting dropouts I

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,299
had 10 to 12 people sign up but then we

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,649
ended up six people being stiff

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,689
attendees as a titty or should I suppose

00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:25,059
it was quite nice to have a smaller

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,429
group because it just meant that you can

00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:30,039
speak off easier whether many people

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,049
looking at you and it was just nice to

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,929
have school over because it just meant a

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:37,269
hat for cheer extreme time as the

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,850
organizer I really wasn't sure it was it

00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:41,740
me they not like the group was it

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,590
weighed a city was laid out I got my

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,039
bike stressed out about it so some

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,299
things to be like emotionally ready for

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,850
for the jobs recruit that I'm running

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,580
now I have 10 people drop out before the

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,379
first meeting these people have met me

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,000
get I hadn't seen how a group would work

00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:00,279
I'm pretty sure they haven't done any of

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,259
the homework assigned yet so my theory

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,360
is that they want to believe they want

00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:08,230
to be programmers or they actually put

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,120
me program so just like how that back

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,779
your mind it's probably not you it's

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:17,590
probably them a few ways to damasus it's

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:19,509
just two types of course earlier I had

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,740
the horse up for about three weeks

00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:24,750
before we started and that wasn't

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,730
enough time for it to get outside myself

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,030
network but most of my friends are

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,770
programmers on at one of course so they

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,200
used to be like brothers the president

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,420
brown and of course the easiest things

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,220
just to overbook but i ended up having

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:43,940
fifty percent drop out rate so my

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:47,070
javascript i can t % to make up for that

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm so random hecho and of course just

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,720
to get some feedback to see what can you

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,610
improve I had an anonymous form open for

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,160
the whole length of course but literally

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,050
no one used it at all without being said

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,700
though I think it's certified apart just

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,890
to have been on this forum available

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,840
there just in case some people alive so

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,870
brave about telling you some feedback

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,420
and I think it would be really helpful

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,309
to run the retros twice one halfway

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,020
through the stranger and one at the end

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:14,880
because the one halfway through would

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,559
guess give you the feedback that was

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,419
necessary to implement

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,009
group study group in for the second half

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,149
saree with any retro it kind of be some

00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,039
tough love you know you're hearing

00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:27,990
things that you need to improve on but

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,749
it's really important to be receptive

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,730
especially if we sharing out on a course

00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:35,340
like this most people probably haven't

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,169
in front of a retro before and so it's

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,730
important for them to lexi is a positive

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:42,149
experience where they can give the exact

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,340
makeup acted upon and I just I think

00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:47,009
once they do give you the feedback take

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,570
the time to internalize it understand

00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,059
what they try to say can be willing to

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,470
improve because it's only going to be

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:56,789
good for you next time you run a retro

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,929
just some roles and parts that are

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,879
required to make soon your time so first

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:05,580
is the organizer this is a role that I

00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:07,710
play but anybody can do it and I think

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,690
it'd be really often though so I wanted

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,119
to guide program maybe they just put the

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,549
group together on their own the

00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,460
organizer asked for registrations they

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,960
must face that has desks the powerpoints

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,210
you know all of all things

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,950
if I hopefully computers to answer your

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,720
questions as you go along I'll be

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,630
another group on your own and feeling

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,940
adventurous you pick the platform I've

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,279
been too nasty but there are a bunch out

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,380
there and if you really want to go for

00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,529
cold you can cope the curricula on your

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,610
own extracting foot speed they all set

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,700
up the emails to make sure that

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,159
everybody's hanging out on track as well

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,260
organizers kind of required to be at

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,029
every meeting so if you want to do a

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,309
group like this if you know your kind of

00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,870
flaky if you take on this role you

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,370
really can't drop out for this door

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,140
otherwise things like okay this is what

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,169
we're doing next week if not they're not

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,789
gonna know and you might like if you are

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:02,190
the one offering the office space you

00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:06,600
kind of have to be that let people in so

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,460
just off they go just in case there are

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,950
some people in this room that I

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,159
programmers ready to or thinking

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,159
happening

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,309
I would say take the leap of faith and

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,350
join a study group I think you better

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,360
lock you will learn much faster than

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,630
being completely on your own because you

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,200
not ask questions get feedback I think

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,429
it's a great environment you will learn

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,929
against to prep for the real world in

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,929
case one day do you become a programmer

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:38,139
stuff I SI joints and for the 50 frozen

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,029
are in this room I say also join a study

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,669
room just joined methods and shooter

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,799
because you can really help to refresh

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,139
your memory might also concepts you

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,440
haven't used a little while it dust off

00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:52,389
the cobwebs and it's a great way to

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,340
continually impractical communication

00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:56,440
skills especially when it comes to

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,840
explain concepts that are quite

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,159
difficult and explaining them in a way

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,950
that is friendly to those that are just

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,750
right now and for all you know ensuring

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,730
you that you cannot hire list might be

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,240
enough room already with you so

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,520
definitely 21 and although that being

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,260
said though

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,900
one thing we have to stress about being

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,430
a tutor though is make sure people that

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,590
are attending the study room are

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,050
responsible for their own learning there

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,270
are become the answers like you just

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,580
want to explain to them concepts and

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,520
give them idea to get the minds working

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,770
but don't just spoon feed them the

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,960
answers like these tutorials do give

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,980
them the tools that is necessary love to

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,720
get to the correct answer and you like

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,670
we said before being the shooter is a

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,890
great way to give back to the community

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,680
I have a lot on so much of the people

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,690
around me people be internet it was

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,270
teach me how to program especially to

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,490
the University so I definitely owe it a

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,390
lot to those people for dedicating their

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,790
time chunk of their life to answering my

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,880
question so I hope that one day when I

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,570
really good to give back but since you

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,570
guys are so

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:13,730
this is totally about role not required

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,710
but I think it's nice facilitator

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,110
somebody who go through the course my

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,049
student they do all the material and

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,850
over anybody else but they have some

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,250
pass program acknowledge that they can

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,890
fill up so I was a facilitator car group

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,559
very new Ruby but I was mute icon I

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,480
think that this helps with programming

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,150
it means that you have somebody there to

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,250
die everybody in the right direction but

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:41,120
it also means that you can learn as you

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,220
go along ask questions as you need to it

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,559
helps a little by your concepts but

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,330
there's some stuff there in this course

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,360
that I haven't gone over since my own

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,030
you what I one days but with nice to go

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,390
back and see well together again of

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,150
course

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,560
I couldn't give the most iconic

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,720
responses to the answers so it's nice to

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,330
add the tutors there to like clean

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,740
everything up and answer questions they

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,870
come along but I do think the

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,600
facilitator helps people sort of

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,030
interactive organized code if you go

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,740
through it is this is above us role

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:20,940
because you can be a facilitator and

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:23,550
organizer show some references that we

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,620
infused throughout my original

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,990
advertisement for the Parsons of my

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,510
website so if you're thinking that maybe

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:33,840
you'd lesser a study group hope you will

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,120
you love to take this one as outlined

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,910
board and we'll just see what I've said

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,040
it's true we do there as well the

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,470
sources so studies that not invention

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,260
from the very beginning of the talk as

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:53,850
well and this let's first a talk

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:55,920
l-com /i the National Cash group finally

00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,240
all the items from today's talking with

00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,140
a nap project these are free and music

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,140
education so

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,200
