00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,780
people are trying to get into the last

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,050
minute they'll walk over your legs and

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:27,340
all that sort of stuff all right um so

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,430
I'll just remove that ok so good morning

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,519
to the second and final day of the

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,900
official part of the conference I hope

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,670
everyone's had a good time yesterday

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,550
we've got a few people who are just

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,970
coming in today so welcome them and show

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,100
them the ropes we sort of did some

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,140
last-minute ticket types for a few

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,140
people who could only come in for one

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,580
day so you might know all the traps and

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,769
where things are but there will be a few

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,769
people who won't so look out for them

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,800
so I think that numbers a little bit old

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,380
I think there's a few more people than

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,930
that so I'm quite happy with those

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,750
numbers and we'll be looking to boost

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,850
those again for next year I think it's

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,260
feeling like deja vu this much that's

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,120
the rights all good all right so an

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,680
important part of our community and

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,650
therefore an important part of the

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,210
conference is a code of conduct we're

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,910
committed to making this conference safe

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,560
and inviting for everyone in attendance

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,090
we have a strong code of conduct which

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,920
you agreed to when you registered and

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,650
when the organized and which the

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,390
organizers take very seriously if you've

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,430
not read it please familiarize himself

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:47,250
with it is available on the conference

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:51,150
website t-shirts we have teacher to the

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,830
registration desk if you registered and

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,580
you've got a t-shirt and it's not quite

00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:01,250
the right size from lunch will be able

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:04,950
to reduce hops for you if we've got

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,720
spares after that from afternoon tea

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,590
onwards you might be able to score

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,060
yourself an extra t-shirt I certainly

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,700
don't want to carry any of the leftover

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:20,520
t-shirts home in my backpack so please

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,790
go get them you'll be saving my back we

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,800
have another session of lightning talks

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,830
the signup board is outside on the

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,550
whiteboards I think there's about half

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:36,360
the slots are still open if lightning

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,600
talk is a short term for short form talk

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,130
five minutes only no ads and no

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:49,530
recruitment pictures you can talk on any

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:52,620
topic that's of interest to you so be

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,660
three our third breakout room that is an

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,690
open space room today so that's set up

00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:01,350
pretty much like we're going to have s1

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,060
set up tomorrow for the sprints so if

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,040
you just want to a quiet space to go and

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,340
do some work v3 is the best place to go

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,340
do that

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,070
we've got sunday schedules available in

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,090
printed form at the registration desk so

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,210
you can pick those up on your way out

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,010
we've just put up a suggestions box in

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,510
the hallway it's a little bit further

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,360
away from the reg a desk so you can

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,800
write all those bad things about us not

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,040
feeling too uncomfortable writing it

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,630
right next to us so please put in the

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,820
registrations are putting their

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,930
suggestions and we'll do our best to

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:45,740
accommodate you into the next year the

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,210
jobs boards the two white boards if you

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,980
are offering work or you're looking for

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,360
work that's a really good space for it

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,520
please keep in mind that lots of people

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,640
trying to fit their advertisements on

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,960
there so just keep them keep them small

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,220
if they get too big we will just rub

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,810
them off the power of being a conference

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,880
registration person you can rub

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:14,850
something off a whiteboard we've got our

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,260
Wi-Fi the SSID is park on a you the

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,040
possibilities pass Clinton because

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:23,310
someone thinks that's funny lunch today

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,680
is uncoated it's down on grey Street we

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,450
do have some special deals with some of

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,080
the vendors from the Icebreaker dinners

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:35,880
and that's all up on the wiki sponsors

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,030
we need to acknowledge our sponsors

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,220
without whom park on Australia would not

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:46,410
be able to take place to the level that

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,710
it does I I do have a big tin shed

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,060
that's available to me so we could run

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,280
it there but I think we'd all much

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,670
prefer to be here um so our platinum

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,120
sponsors our first platinum sponsor is

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,070
event right and now I'd like to welcome

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,080
Simon willington the director of

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:11,300
architecture eventbrite to say a few

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,300
words okay

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,290
good morning everyone so having bought

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,450
my bought our way on stage I'd first

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,160
like to say thank you very much for for

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,600
participating this event it we're very

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,490
proud to have sponsored it and then I

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,380
feel having bought my way up here that

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,120
we have a moral imperative to at least

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,010
try and show you something interesting

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,840
and hopefully informative with the

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,580
couple of minutes that we've got on the

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,990
schedule today so I'm going to show you

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,460
a tool that we've been developing ad

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,110
eventbrite which we intend to open

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,660
source from least to the community and

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,729
that helps us sort of with debugging and

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,190
understanding how how our large-scale

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,870
Django applications working and that's

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,760
tool that we're calling the tiki bar

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,350
it's this little orange bar that appears

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,780
at the top of every page an event right

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,870
this is available to staff members only

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,850
and the idea is to try and try and

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,250
provide insight into how the application

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,870
is working but with with the smallest

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,880
amount of performance overhead possible

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,440
if your django developers you'll no

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,090
doubt of use the django debug tool bar

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,830
which is a fabulous tool but it has

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,810
quite a big overhead it does stack

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,790
traces and every sequel call it adds a

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,410
half a megabyte of HTML to the bottom

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,120
every page it's not really something

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,500
that you can run on a production site

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,420
it's only something that works in your

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,820
development environment so the tiki bar

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,320
is a much more lightweight

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,790
implementation of a similar idea and as

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,040
you can see it shows up the top of the

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,930
page it's got a little Tiki God grinning

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,150
at you it can show you a breakdown of

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,830
time spent in sequel versus other things

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,390
shows you all of the sequel statements

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,520
that then used on the page it can show

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,520
which template files and view functions

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,410
have been used and because we know the

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,120
most recently deployed get hash we can

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,160
actually link these directly to view

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,440
source on github for that version of the

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,330
page so this gives you a instant view

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,160
source for the server-side code that's

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,900
carrying your website and it'll show you

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,240
log lines that are emitted and then if

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,980
you go to a page that uses Ajax calls

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,450
there's this little counter at the top

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,340
the requests counter which tix up in

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,260
real time as those aged actor calls

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,540
trigger if you open up that pain you can

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,070
actually inspect an individual Ajax call

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,720
that was made on that page and you can

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,610
see the sequel queries and the log lines

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,650
and the Python view function who is used

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,400
for that as well we also maintain a

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,780
history of the most recent 20 requests

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,760
that you've made so that if you went

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,430
through a redirect through a 301 we can

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,440
still show you that

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,210
and I didn't go to redirect we can show

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,670
you the full debug information from your

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,260
previous request as well now the

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,480
important thing about a tool like this

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,399
is it needs to firstly it needs to not

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,589
impact the performance of your site and

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,200
secondly it needs to be as secure as you

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,510
can make it so the way we do that is if

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,529
we view source on this page the only

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:51,520
additional things on this page are a

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:54,250
meta tag somewhere a meta tag which has

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,660
a unique ID in it and then a single line

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,339
JavaScript included the bottom of the

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,800
page that loads and everything else so

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,950
then based on that that's that unique ID

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,630
that that unique identifier actually

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,790
maps to a memcache key so at the end of

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,990
each request that we serve we take all

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,640
of the debugging information we've

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,100
collected during that request we do a

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,290
single right to memcache to write a JSON

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,180
blob in the last five minutes and then

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,370
if the tiki bar gets activated on it on

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,350
the page itself it can pull that data

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,000
directly out of mem cached and displayed

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,980
at the top of the page and the bar

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,649
itself is in an iframe which means that

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,410
we can serve it over HTTPS even if the

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,120
rest of the page was served over HTTP so

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm going to be around tomorrow for at

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,360
least the morning of the sprints if

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,850
you're interested in this tool and want

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,050
to potentially help us get it to get it

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,300
to a point where we can open source it

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,190
please come and talk to us and of course

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,350
as a sponsor I have to say that we are

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,330
enthusiastically hiring python django

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,220
developers if you're interested please

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,870
come talk to myself or Andrew Godwin

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,260

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:04,820

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:08,980

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,310
thanks Chris

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,590
our gold sponsors Google Arnett and new

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,590
box blue I have to put in a special

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,880
shout-out to networks blue my employer

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,380
that generally means you show up to work

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,150
and work I haven't done that this week

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:46,270
our parent organization is linux

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,370
australia park on australia is an event

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,200
that's run under the auspices of linux

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,970
australia who provide the legal

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,630
framework and financial support to make

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:58,200
this event take place so if you can

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,340
imagine that putting deposits down and

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,820
getting insurance all those sort of

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,800
things doing those things for all of

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,960
these events every time would be a

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,820
nightmare so Linux Australia does all of

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,410
that setup work for us and we just get

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,410
to reuse that every year

00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:23,850
I'm not going to do a jig for you

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:34,380
that's true goodness me how am I going

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:41,250

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:51,149
