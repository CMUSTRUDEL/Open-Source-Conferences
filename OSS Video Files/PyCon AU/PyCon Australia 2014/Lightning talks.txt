	00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:26,480
I said a hip hop hippie-dippie to the

hip hip hop and you don't stop talking

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,930
about the bang bang boogie say I'll jump

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,480
the boogie to the rhythm of the boogity

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,720
beat now this is not a dress rehearsal

on the first one in the queue and me and

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,039
the other lightning talks we're going to

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,679
show you something new you see I am

00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,410
Larry Hastings and I'd like to say hello

00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,539
to the black to the white thread and the

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,640
brown to the purple and Guido but first

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,289
I've got a a bang bang boogie to the

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,239
woogie say I'm jumped the buggy to the

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,980
bang bang boogie let's rock and you

00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,589
don't stop Rock the knowledge that will

00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,570
make your Python Rodwell so far you've

00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,760
heard my voice but it's time for me to

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,319
go and next on them like another

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,190
lightning talks oh come on we're going

00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,190
to start this show

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,040
Larry Hastings everyone so we've got

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,200
cash lightning talks to get through but

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,510
we're going in to leave it with more

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,430
prize giveaways so is Josh to pray in

00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:27,710
here right you've won a book from

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:34,220
O'Reilly Media come on down and david DD

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:37,100
make a start trying to fall tryna that's

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,310
great yes trying to follow that's going

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,170
to be impossible I to any which way so

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,940
i'm david BTW i'm from townsville north

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,030
queensland quick show hands anyone else

00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,660
here from North Queensland one person

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,920
yes well finally got one excellent oh

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,590
and Nick Crouch can you set up over here

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,260
please so anyway now for something

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,060
completely different so we're all here

00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,200
because we like Python I'd love Python

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,910
I'm Python programmer a developer work

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,890
with all sorts of different aspects of

00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,170
Python and effectively I thought well

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,450
let's have some fun let's make this

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,190
conference a little bit less serious

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,720
unfortunately that's no longer the case

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,570
because we've already had a dance act

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,920
but anyway but anyway it's Sunday so

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,970
let's be a little bit silly so

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,790
effectively have you ever wanted to

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,830
easily add references to your code in

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,000
particular Python and have you ever

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,280
wondered exactly how many references

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,890
there are two Monty Python in pipe

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,180
itself let's find out so effectively

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,560
things you might already probably know

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,450
pythons name is from flying circus

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,130
there's a great post from Guido there's

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,900
the link have a look at it other things

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,480
like the idle editor comes from Eric

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,430
Idle cheese shop mystery shop sketch

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,900
this various different packages named

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,450
albatross all sorts of different things

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,760
cheese wheels and so on there's various

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,500
different there's different sketches and

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,989
in comedian references all throughout

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,420
the documentation and also through the

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,730
tests as well and effectively the long

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,040
story short is that if you read through

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,540
the original post Guido initially under

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,049
analyzed the languages name because it's

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,780
the first thing that came to his mind

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:13,610
unless I'm do all of that right now so

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,380
here I am introducing a package called

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,940
blancmange if you know what a blancmange

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,290
is then you'll know it's a sweet creamy

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,840
dessert and it was very popular in the

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,330
UK in the 1970s and it's the topic of

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,720
much of

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,210
besides seven which is which is our

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,530
you're no fun anymore on and so

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,570
effectively now this is a pine marten

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,920
Python analysis package for Python which

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,210
you can easily install beware the in the

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,490
episode if you haven't seen it the bull

00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,420
monsters play play tennis try to take

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,280
over Wimbledon there are

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,920
extraterrestrials what's the episode

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,660
thank me later effectively yeah so the

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,910
code is quite raw I started working on

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,980
Thursday night on a whim and it comes

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,180
with five different console scripts for

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,690
instance the first one actually

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,520
processes some HTML HTML for or some

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,170
whoo with font tags and all that and

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,180
effectively it takes all the original

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,480
sketches sketches and divides them into

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,040
a SQLite database you've also got some

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,920
different other scripts as well analysis

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,200
for flying circus it's got it actually

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,570
tells you some interesting stats 165,000

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,520
spoken words Michael Palin said twenty

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,010
four point three percent of them 500

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,739
sketches 10,000 lines spoken and almost

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,049
250,000 words and the whole scripts you

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,910
can also do things like spot camels so

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,250
find sketches the feature certain

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,830
keywords and you can pick up random

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,410
lines from Python Monty Python that is

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,940
and you can even have them exported as

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,800
comments so you can actually just copy

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,470
and paste mess render your code so go

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,760
ahead do that and and the final one that

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,260
I've added is the script called blood

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,110
knowledge which effectively takes a path

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,510
and process a directory of files for

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,790
instance C Python and attempts to match

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,530
it with the sprints and outputs the most

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,320
common references which ones are missing

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,210
and statistics on some actors and so

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,350
effectively yes is this all completely

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,820
insane very possibly but any which way

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,700
so effectively we can run this blue

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,350
manuscript over over C Python night

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,570
turns out night had text analysis of

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,040
arbitrary sources is very hard we

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,000
extract data using W get and PI query

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,650
extract words and counts from the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,770
episodes using text blob and the natural

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,690
language toolkit ltk excluding short

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,570
words and Python syntax using pigments

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,330
and normalize using the NLT k brown

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,430
corpus and the the corpus of this witch

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,370
collection of words is from 19 sorry

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,470
1979 it's old but the thing is so spy

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,060
pants it's perfect and effectively long

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,800
story short you wait about 45 minutes

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
because my code is very inefficient

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,409
if you've got suggestions and like to

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,139
work on this with me please come and

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:42,629
find me and the end result is the

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,229
results are pickled for salad insanity

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:50,509
insanity so what do you think would be

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:54,810
the top reference in C Python get out

00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:58,259
you are exactly right so spam huh that's

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,400
right and as it turns out Flying Circus

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:05,490
has 76 references to spam see python has

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,069
2225 but the most common the most common

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,080
reference to monty python is actually

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:13,159
Eric Idle because he's got the Eric he's

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,900
got the idol editor and he's mentioned

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,629
3495 times in C Python and he's also

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,370
part of lib idol as well so if you're

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,139
running your code effectively mentioned

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,750
John Cleese more and definitely terry

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,520
gilliam his animations are fantastic yep

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,469
thank you thank you that's right and

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,270
effectively the long story short is that

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,690
almost all references are actually in

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,620
the documentation everyone thanks David

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,719
baby please why is Tim bell in the room

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,930
this way sprays your hand fantastic come

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:45,479
and get a book up next on deck we have

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:51,240
Indra to lip over this side our but

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:55,740
first Nick crouch can everyone hear me

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,349
yep there we go cool so um I go to

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,729
university and I want to start by saying

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:05,129
I'm not having a go at anyone I work

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,659
with extremely intelligent people I just

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:12,779
think they're misguided in this instance

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:14,940
um we're moving from using Java as our

00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,319
introductory programming language which

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,310
i think is great because job is a

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:25,379
terrible introductory programming

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:28,400
language to to see which is not a great

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:31,250
introductory programming language um and

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,409
I've had had this argument out

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,810
unfortunately I'm an honors student and

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,370
people don't listen to me and you

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,719
wouldn't listen to me if I wasn't up

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,849
here you're probably not listening to me

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:47,039
anyway so so I need help and this is the

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,399
reason let's face it Python is a much

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,380
better language then see I'm just going

00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,599
to leave that hanging I don't want to

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:59,580
limit the domain but especially for

00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,800
teaching and the arguments for see that

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,190
I've heard that you know Newark

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,930
instructor see a better you know the

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,919
electrical engineers need to know see

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,240
where we're saving time you know paipan

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,159
might be the most popular teaching

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,419
language in the States but I hear that's

00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:22,469
just because they're doing Dumber

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:26,310
introductory programming and sorry and

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:28,560
you know I I don't agree I don't think

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,539
any of you guys agree but unfortunately

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,029
a people don't listen to me as discussed

00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:35,490
earlier but I'm also I don't know enough

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,459
about either Python or C to make this

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,469
argument intelligently and so I'm asking

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:43,229
a whole bunch of people who know a very

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,760
big amount about Python and you know

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,130
some of you probably know quite a lot

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,899
about see as well to help me out on this

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:54,839
one because quite frankly it's not just

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,290
me that um that's going to be worried

00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,949
about this this is my university but as

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,120
we spoke about on the first day we're

00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:05,730
looking to get a whole bunch of people

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,870
using Python young people using Python

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,699
in the next four or five years and I

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,310
don't know about you guys but in my home

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:16,910
state of South Australia educational

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,649
policy is driven by higher education and

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,190
so if the universities are using C or

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:26,250
C++ I guarantee the schools will start

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,170
to use C C++ Java languages we don't

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,970
want them using so if we can get them

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,740
using Python then that will flow down

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,620
and we'll all be much happier as a

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,260
result so I guess what I'm asking for in

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,260
this extraordinarily short lightning

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,120
talk is to log onto this wiki and give

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,800
me some really good arguments or email

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,319
me with some fantastic arguments or

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,040
people i can send the people who make

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:52,980
decisions to to argue with them about

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,449
why python is rh better teaching

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,630
language then see because i tried and

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,910
they don't listen to me so maybe maybe

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,280
someone can

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,250
can try harder or or try better I

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,800
suppose and and help me out on this one

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,440
so because this is an extraordinary

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,500
short lightning talk even for lightning

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:49,010
talks here's a picture of a bunny where

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:51,500
the pancake from its head so the first

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,420
thing I'm not Jim Baker he gave this

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,760
talk as a lightning talk add you're a

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,920
Python a couple of weeks ago and he has

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,480
way more experience in this and knows

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
what the hell he's talking about I've

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,390
shamelessly ripped off his slides

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,580
because he license to them as creative

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:09,380
commons thank you so I decided to do

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,270
this because someone asked Nick goblin

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,710
the question yesterday you know when C

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,480
Python does stuff does that affect the

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,430
other distributions and or the other

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,990
implementations and they referenced pi

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,880
PI and ironpython and not join so spare

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,640
our mini displayport adapter that we

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,210
could borrow perhaps up here so

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,610
basically jathan is currently aiming for

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,510
2.7 it's been aiming for 2.7 for a while

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,150
now the first alpha got cut februari odd

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,590
last year it's currently at beta 3 i've

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:44,300
been running it in production for the

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,980
last 18 months and i've actually only

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,720
been submitting pull request to the

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,070
jonathan project in the last eight

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,960
months i'm going to talk really fast and

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,660
hope that you ignore the fact that i

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,010
don't know what i'm talking about so

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,600
we're going to race through a bit of

00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:01,220
what Jim talked about so basically Java

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,410
7 is now the minimum version that gives

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,810
us a lot of new functionality that java

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,390
7 brings to the table like auto closable

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,150
which makes it much nicer to work with

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,350
you can mix Python and Java types into

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,000
the basis of your classes when you're

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,640
defining them there's now support for

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,680
buffer

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,190
memory of you there's improved support

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,040
in the console for the Chinese character

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,020
sets and Japanese and Korean you can do

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,480
relative star imports and there's been

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,030
many many many many many other small bug

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,160
fixes and I swear I didn't modify these

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,190
slides to include this but the busy to

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,670
support was mine and it fixed all the

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,160
regression tests in tar file Jim however

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,150
did do this he did the socket River

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,740
because Pip and pipe i went to ssl and

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,800
implementation of the socket module

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,560
enjoy 'then sucked and so it was

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,690
reimplemented in top of Nettie which is

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,330
a fairly nice framework to do it in and

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:03,210
so it's a lot more performant and it now

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:08,610
supports requests so again handy because

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:12,690
pip uses it and then the Python package

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,940
sorry the pipe eru requires SSL and so

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,100
it's all kind of circular and there's a

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,360
few little bits that aren't working but

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,990
hopefully they'll get fixed by the time

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Jonathan goes 2.7 full release whatever

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,940
that's called regular expressions again

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,440
I didn't modify this slide but I did fix

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,540
it so when you attempted to pass a HTML

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,420
file of about three hundred kilobytes

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,500
with beautiful soup enjoyin it took five

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,390
minutes because it has to convert the to

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,960
unicode code points which are 32-bit

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,500
blah blah blah and that was slow and

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,600
beautiful soup passes the entire three

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,940
hundred kilobytes of the HTML to the

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,270
regex engine every single time it calls

00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,030
the regex engine so i put in a very very

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,730
nasty little hack where I just memorize

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:08,550
it and it runs in about five seconds now

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:11,370
yay so there's a lot of other things in

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,930
the giant ecosystem that sit around it

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,640
they're deliberately kept out of the

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,440
core so that they can continue to be

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,510
worked on and evolved faster than what

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,820
the core can because the core tends to

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,060
move very slowly there's not that many

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,440
committees and you know it doesn't go

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,230
very fast so I'm going to try and race

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,960
through some of these and I have had

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,690
thing to do with them other than read

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,070
them so clamp allows you jathan has

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,490
always had a fairly good story about

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:40,910
using Java from Jason or from Python

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,890
drama however using jython or Python

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,830
from Java involves a lot of boilerplate

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,280
and nasty nasty knowledge of the

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:53,140
internals one minute oh crap so that's

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:56,540
that's Python using a Java this is a

00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,320
Python telling it should be clamped and

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,230
this is Java now able to import and run

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,410
a python class no that's setuptools

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,080
building the jar file this is Java using

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,960
Python without having to use an

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,490
interpreter and all the other rest of it

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,380
currently jiffy pure vapor where the

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,290
intention is to use cff be able to

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,060
provide a CFO fight back end and I'd

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,170
model entirely sure but it's examples of

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:26,980
how to write cross compatible stuff JJ

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,330
and I came out of wanting to use numpy

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,790
enjoyin so it's providing the sea

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,610
extension API support inside of Jason

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,620
it's still got a little way to go but

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,900
you know it's getting there they're

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,180
doing a beta for nearly computer bug

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,740
triage they're aiming for more

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,800
performance fixes more hooks into the

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,270
Java there's crazy research coming out

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:53,870
of Oracle everyone please thank India

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:59,480
okay so on they're over on Peter loved

00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:03,020
it but first Tim Ansel so I have too

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,950
many projects and I need to sleep again

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:10,100
I would love some help on doing some of

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,920
them um eternally is talk could be

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,200
titled what you could hack on during

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,090
sprints this is an exhaustive list but

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,890
this is some of the things I think that

00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,780
would be also for you first one is a

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,200
thing called slide lint which if you are

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:29,870
at last year's pike on a year you would

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,790
have even seen me given a talk on it a

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,980
lot in lightning talk it's basically a

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,750
proofreader it had a command-line

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,000
interface but had a lot of dependencies

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,340
was quite hard to install so now we have

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,110
a website version where you can go and

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:48,670
check your presentations for common

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,170
problems that make AV people unhappy

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,870
this is kind of it checking my own

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,270
presentation and find out that I have

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,420
issues in my own presentation it's

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,460
slightly internet the codes all open

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,250
source go and download and help us fix

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,320
it I could really use some help with

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,930
just standard English grammar I'm not

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,510
particularly good at that we need logo

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,330
but also need you checkers it's all

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,580
written in Python so it seems like a

00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,170
perfect conference to have it and the

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,960
next thing is we've been doing live

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,900
video streaming from the conference and

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,240
a bunch of other open source conferences

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,550
and the tools that are being using for

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,300
that a kind of in a collection cool

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,460
Tim's video as you can see it's quite a

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,850
lot of things going on and they all need

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,010
lots of work the first thing is a thing

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,620
called the hdmi to USB which were not

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,080
quite using it but hope to soon it's a

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,840
hdmi DVI capture solution that's all

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,730
Foss the PCB schematic and all the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,920
firmware is open source while the

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,260
firmware is obviously written in non

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,770
python because you can't load python on

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:03,140
to fpga yet there's a lot of help is

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,840
that are written in python like linting

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,570
tools

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,450
builders debug scripts cogeneration as

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:14,100
well the PCB and schematic are written

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:17,429
in I done with Chi khadke card is Python

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,130
extendable so more Python Python seems

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,650
to be everywhere the next thing is GST

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,710
switch it's a software video switcher

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,950
again was still not quite using this but

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,529
it has a nice python api and that would

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,120
love some work and this is the part that

00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,580
we are using it's a streaming system

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,799
this is what looks like on the web you

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,390
can see that you can kind of see the

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,320
previews it gives you the schedule

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,880
Twitter IRC all this type of thing

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,380
supposed to kind of give you a nice way

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,760
to browse the conference it has kind of

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,299
two parts the front end and back end

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,600
it's as much Python as there is Python

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,970
the front ends or Django it needs a lot

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,909
of love i'm not a django programmer and

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,100
this has been developed pretty much just

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,590
in time at conferences so you can

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,559
imagine it's not the best code and but

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,549
it is python so at least it doesn't look

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,399
like pearl the back end is flew motion

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,720
it's written in gstreamer and python all

00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:22,950
our deploy scripts are like shell so and

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,130
we have a hacking monitoring scripts

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:29,039
written in python again all python love

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,980
your help this helps get people to car

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,830
at n pi khan who can't afford to get

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,610
here or otherwise carter 10 so i think

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:41,820
that's kind of important I have another

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,590
poor another important project I reckon

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,679
you should use and that's Python

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,659
datetime TZ it's a datetime compatible

00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,480
module that deeply cares about time

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:54,720
zones and understands things like there

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,850
are hours that don't exist and things

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,710
like that it's not like the time the

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,380
normal date time that just kind of gives

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:05,309
up and then use it with PI T Z and it

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,649
gets wrong it uses pite easy and that

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,770
stuff internally it just makes sure that

00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:14,370
it gets right it is a bit slow but at

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:16,500
least your dates are wrong i also have a

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,330
bunch of other projects as you as i said

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,789
i have lots of projects

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,000
need help and don't like sleeping

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:29,149
apparently first one is a little finance

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,440
tool it's written in Django to let him

00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:35,700
another one there's a vent everywhere

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,700
again Python it's designed to try and

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:44,149
make it so organizing user group sucks

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:48,419
less I also maintain a version of a

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:52,559
lightning timer which is much easier on

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:56,159
I started at the same time no you did in

00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:03,179
five four three everyone thanked him and

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:04,950
saw that Tim gives this talk every year

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,019
so perhaps if you help on some of his

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,980
projects tomorrow he won't take up a

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,889
slot next year on deck we have four cow

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,870
but first pedal others good thank you

00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:18,000
thank you hello everyone I want to talk

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,529
about source code and I am pedal of it

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,929
now when I talk about source code I've

00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:25,440
seen a lot of source code on displays

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:28,019
over the last 23 days and you probably

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,850
work with source code and I talked about

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:31,350
saw squad I'm not talking actually about

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,120
source code and i'm also not talking

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,980
about source code the movie although

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,380
it's a good movie and this is the same

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,110
font but different so take my advice

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,760
it's good advice I've seen some code

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,639
over the last three days and you might

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,289
even work with source code in Helvetica

00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:51,720
that is a terrible font whether you

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:55,860
Coral aerial or colibri don't use

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,559
helvetica as your coding font worse x

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,090
times new roman if you're going to use x

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,590
well why not just use Comic Sans

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,750
although if you can tell me what the

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,110
difference between some of those are

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:13,139
good on you why not just use something

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,269
like that that would be more fun um so

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:20,059
don't use a proportional font like those

00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:20,059
use a fixed pitch font like

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,570
yeah and if you can tell the difference

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:28,960
between any of those ones and eyes good

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,230
on you orrow zorro zorro zorro s good on

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,610
you instead a much better much nicer fun

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,429
if you're in the windows work our

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,649
interlude one just for the UNIX people

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,419
if you're using mah no space then that

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:43,149
will map if you've got a mono space in

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:46,990
an HTML page the windows people will see

00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:50,429
that in Korea so why not use a nice one

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,840
like console us it's a Microsoft font

00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,940
but it's actually a really good program

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,399
respondents been around since um server

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,840
2008 comes with windows seven that's

00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:02,200
really nice but this talk is about

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:08,320
source code so interlude number two

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:11,129
adobe they've done some bad things I'm

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,139
thinking PDF with JavaScript embedded

00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:16,269
but they are actually they actually know

00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:18,700
fonts and they do really good fonts and

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:21,940
they do a lovely font called Adobe

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,419
source code pro it's a programmers font

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,480
it's got marvelous distinctions between

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:30,850
il-1 pipe zero capital oh it's a it's

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,620
actually a great font and it's good for

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,940
programmers from the talk from the

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,320
keynote at the beginning of this morning

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,450
it's really good for accessibility

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,500
because it's got very clear distinctions

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:45,879
it's open source Oh a part of the open

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,460
type system comes in variable fonts OTF

00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:49,960
tdf SVG if you don't if you want

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,090
something that's a bit more bold but not

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,340
quite as bold as bold comes in six

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,809
different weights so six different

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,360
heaviness a--'s platform-independent

00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,639
works on Windows works on unix works on

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,899
OSX etc that's where you can get it

00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:08,860
thank you every way please think people

00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:16,509
love it so on deck we have Elna Williams

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:18,580
a but first hawk owl can we turn the

00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:20,649
lectern mic on over here please hello

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,169
nope there yup there we go okay

00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:25,509
brilliant hi I'm Hawk out you've

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:28,059
probably seen me before I've been doing

00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:29,980
lightning talks and thinks I'm the

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,850
twisted release manager it's basically

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,490
the only important thing I've ever done

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm here to talk about Saratoga it is a

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:40,440
small API framework that runs on top of

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,450
twisted and I discuss some of the ideas

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,020
behind his creation earlier today in at

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:49,020
building better web api's basically it

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,760
makes your api out of implementations

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,590
which is a thing that does stuff and

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:58,950
definitions which is what your api is

00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:02,430
this is an example as a implementation

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,930
so for example i'll just go into it so

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,520
everything is versions your API has

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:11,490
versions versions have endpoints and

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,510
these endpoints map two functions your

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,360
functions then return data so if we have

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:23,490
a look at it you'll see that that there

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,620
is the API then it has a version then it

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,540
has an endpoint or a function and then

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:33,140
it returns data and and then that is an

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:36,950
N you pass it into Center agar AAP I

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:40,620
with your API definition which is Jason

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:44,880
so the simplest possible JSON is

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,680
basically this you have made a data

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
which is global across your API which

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,740
has been you can have like title and

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,020
what versions you have you then have yet

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,750
so you have versions which are both

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,630
global and in each processor each

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,460
endpoint which is like a URL endpoint

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,110
can have multiple processes that span

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,150
version so version 1 and version to you

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,010
can have the same processor and in

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,040
version 3 can have one so that's where

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,240
your JSON schema and all that is tied to

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,920
so we have a look you've just got your

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,590
metadata your endpoint so yes I do have

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,020
a demo it's of twin odns which is a

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,230
replacement for the leno dns thing

00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,120
scoring them on how not how to do it is

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,010
built on top of saratoga twisted and

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,160
json schema it's not live because I've

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:34,230
learned so for example we're just using

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:39,990
user password here we go do it you get

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:44,460
nothing we then do some stuff and we

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,330
create a domain we then look at it again

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,230
comes back

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,310
back we look at the a records under it

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,190
there's nothing because we haven't put

00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:56,210
anything there yet we put in a record

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,560
their query it scene that's there and

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,560
then we can query it and it actually

00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:06,000
comes out on a real dns server so all of

00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:08,220
that was done in about is so you can see

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,200
that it's actually hung out so all of

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,200
that was done about 320 lines of code

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,940
and about 247 lines of JSON schema that

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,800
is all of the stuff you saw there was

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,260
validated both on the input and output

00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,690
and it makes sure that everything is

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,690
what should be so IP v4 or v6 addresses

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,040
you won't turn anything else and most of

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,300
the code is just wrangling with

00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,880
databases and things like that so yes

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,100
that's basically shorts an end of it so

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,100
you can get it at on my github and

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:44,040
there's no docs so yell at me until I

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:48,390
make them that'd be nice thanks hey

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,870
everybody please thank walk out so on

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,490
deck over this side we have tom eastman

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:58,380
but first Eleanor Williams is going to

00:27:53,490 --> 00:28:01,680
tell us all about Django girls yay cious

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,990
oh hi there um you will note i have a

00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,000
conspicuous physical difference this is

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,750
very confusing and frustrating for me

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,470
you're short yeah yeah it's my hair I

00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:15,240
think and I haven't really been sure as

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,640
to what to do with this for the duration

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,040
of my technical life and so I my latest

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,220
strategy is to merely bring other people

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,230
with similar can physical differences

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,750
into this environment and see what

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,670
happened it seemed absolutely absurd to

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,590
me that there aren't more people you

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:36,390
know with this thing going on in our

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,640
community and I so it turns out there's

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,780
this thing called Jango girls now um I

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,750
don't know if any of you guys have had a

00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,830
ruby girls it's a thing that's been

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,240
around for ages because the Ruby

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,960
community is really good at that kind of

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,850
stuff but the two ollas who organized um

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,060
I don't know if you guys heard of Jango

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:56,460
con in Europe a couple years ago the one

00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,420
with the circus that was really really

00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,560
crazy six

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,030
full and really good one of those

00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,760
legendary conferences it was organized

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,770
by these two chicks Allah and Allah and

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,880
they had this brainwave this year to do

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,590
this thing called Jango goes it's a

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,690
brand spanking new invention they only

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,640
decided to do it a few months ago and

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,140
basically it's based on the Ruby girls

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,890
model but done by us so it's going to be

00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,660
better and their event was tremendously

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,520
successful they put aside 19 tickets

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,320
they had hundreds of responses they flew

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,560
girls in from all over Europe they ended

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,980
up having 45 girls participate in all of

00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,050
Europe I thon they the female attendants

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,240
went from five percent to ten percent

00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:36,240
they doubled it with your attendance of

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,590
their Django girls they I saw them put

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
this up like a couple weeks after they

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,560
announced it was like five weeks out

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,910
from this and I went I looked at what I

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,410
yeah that's cool and then I thought

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,480
about it and then weirder user group

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,220
meeting and I'm like I should run one of

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,390
those here they've already done all of

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,670
the hard work like they relieved

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,980
talented powers themselves so I went and

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,180
copied their entire format and decided

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,670
to run it here with a very short lead

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,040
time in a very so like I was kind of

00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,150
scraping a way to try and get people and

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,920
things organized and I'm very grateful

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:05,070
to Clinton for accommodating us and

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,430
stuff like that and so we've pulled

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,770
together an event here to there I wasn't

00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:14,760
the only person who contacted them they

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,490
have since had 50 50 in like six weeks

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,260
ct's contact them to run other events 69

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,420
we are event number two here in

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,980
Australia there are 16 other events on

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,050
the cards they're going to happen

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,840
there's one Argentinian that's already

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,040
on the way and so basically the people

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,710
are willing and all of us have had the

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,210
problem of a massive over popularity

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,110
that was a problem for me I the very

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,430
interesting problem everything was

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,230
working and then I had way too many

00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,490
people apply and I didn't really know

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,740
what to do about that because I really

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:45,630
didn't want to turn anyone away so what

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,980
I'm doing is I am running for yes that

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,330
was aimed at women in have a program for

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,680
we have this in other addition problem

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,910
where everyone who to come to as fifty

00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,490
percent of them really high profile

00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:56,130
projects that's a that was a thing the

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,680
so we're going to turn up to the

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,750
Sprint's tomorrow so we're having half a

00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,800
day of django girls and what I hope to

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,940
do is introduce these people to open

00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,500
source like that's my stick so tomorrow

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,880
we're going to turn up in

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,030
love the sprint I'm going to bring a big

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,330
pile of other strange looking people and

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,280
um I'm asking something of you people a

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,230

thing you'll be asked about this

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,760
conference and probably the hardest

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,950
thing in the whole entire world I am

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,500
asking you to come up to us and say

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:35,960
hello you're a project leader or

00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:40,230
involved in a project I want you to

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,950
think about tasks very specific tasks

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,030
that these people can do when I asked

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,580
everyone i said i'd you want to be

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,430
involved in open source by the way do

00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,280
you know what that is right and every

00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,720
single attendee said yeah and ninety

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,630

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,820
have no idea how once i'm like well all

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:06,240
you need it all we needed to do is ask

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:08,670
so please when we turn up invite people

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,690
along to your table to you know come

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,100
check something out if you have

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,190
something really specific that somebody

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,620
can do that would be awesome I hope to

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,390
do this again I have to do it again next

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,670
year if you'd better organized and be

00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,680
able to invite everybody and be able to

00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,090
facilitate a larger number and all

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,470
different kinds of people and introduce

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,680
or greater from kinds of people are in

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,480
anybody any female with a good grasp of

00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,890
English can learn to program and should

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,780
be part of our community because there's

00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:38,250
a stigma amongst women that it's a boy

00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:40,560
thing and that's ridiculous okay thank

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,470

first tom eastman hi I'm Tom I'm one of

00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:31,250
the organizers of Kiwi PyCon 2014 and

00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,870
here are apparently five reasons you

00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,580
should come I need to preface this by

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,350
saying I don't know what these reasons

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,450
are these slides were emailed to me

00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,820
earlier today and I don't know it's on

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,300
them so I hope they're good reasons and

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,060
I want and I want us to come up with a

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,700
better reason for each one so reason 1

00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:54,560
it is just over the ditch in beautiful

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,270
sunny windy Wellington not far honest we

00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,670
can do better than that there is nothing

00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,990
more exciting in the world than landing

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,760
at Wellington Airport you haven't lived

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,480
until you've landed at wellington

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,080
airport so we have reason 1a come for

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,590
the flight stay for the stable ground

00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,060
when you let out earthquakes nevermind

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,090
number to meet lots of your fellow in

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:21,080
public iphone iSTA's that's also true

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:24,020

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,179
have a guy from nua teaching us that we

00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,650
have a former penetration tester from

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,330
aura security teaching people about web

00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,150
security he'll be teaching people more

00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,890
about what I talked about earlier deep

00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,030
dive and understanding human language

00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,150
with Python natural language processing

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,620
in Python that's cool assemble develop

00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,890
and deploy Python programs would build

00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:01,370
out man build out I have I have

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,630
flashbacks about build out and reason 3a

00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,020
is that's never all you

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,520
is it so and also teach them like if you

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,560

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,970
tutorial and if you can break his stuff

00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,940

partly is going to be our last lightning

00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:36,310
talk presenter but i'm going to try

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,740
something different after him people who

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,110
are planning on leading sprints so are

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,790
representing projects i will be

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,040
sprinting tomorrow if you could like

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,350
prepare like 30 seconds worth of of

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,000
spiel about what you'll be sprinting on

00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,990
tomorrow and line up there and present

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,480
it after Josh that will be fantastic

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:59,770
over this side and hopefully it's not

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,740
just Russell but Josh Bartlett I start

00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,660
alright so I'm Josh Bartlett and I

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,030
thought it'd be fun to introduce you to

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,410
a little bit about generators in Python

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,450
you probably already know a bit it's a

00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,150
fun language feature I thought I'd just

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,730
help explore what generators do and what

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,470
you should not do with them so for a

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:21,250
start you probably already know that

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:23,410
when you do this for example what you're

00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,510
actually doing is you're creating an

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,400
iterator you're calling next on that

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,680
iterator you're calling next on that

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,840
iterator again until it raises stop

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,910
iteration so that's probably something

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,350
that you're already aware of you

00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,120
probably also know that you can create

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,910
these things called generators using the

00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,590
yield keyword and in a similar way you

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,930
can iterate over them so if I create an

00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,580
iterator from it call next on it it

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,140
returns the first year the second year

00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,090
of the third yield so on and then

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,750
finally raises stop iteration so that's

00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:54,970
how it works when you loop over some fun

00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:59,200
things that you may not be aware of with

00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,540
generators so ads of Python 3.3 you can

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,360
actually push values back into these

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,400
yields so here you go I've got some

00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,500
yields and assigning the yield to a

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,810
variable what's that going to do okay so

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,130
I create an object just to prove to you

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:16,900
that I don't have to call the eater

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:19,180
function eater of G is G so if I call

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,349
next on G our flow has continued to the

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,119
first yield where it says

00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,410
three what I'm going to do is instead of

00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,180
calling next turn again i'm going to

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,349
call this function called send what

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,239
that's going to do is it's going to put

00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:31,539
this number five in back into the

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,069
function as X so you actually have two

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,859
way communication with these generator

00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:37,809
functions so i can send so you see I've

00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:41,499
got ten back out that's because X was

00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:43,390
five times two is yielded in the second

00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,220
yield that's what I get out send a three

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,920
back in I get three plus five is eight I

00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,470
so it's all well and good what if I do

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,599
something like this okay so you might

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,029
think that the yield statement could

00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,729
never possibly raise an exception you

00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:59,920
would be wrong so I'm going to create a

00:38:57,729 --> 00:39:01,630
generator from this and you know I can

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,910
just do a normal next and i'll get none

00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,109
out do next again I'll look I've got 20

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,239
minutes of battery that's good i'm not

00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,859
going to be talking for 20 minutes all

00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,819
right so i get stop iteration that's all

00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:14,049
well and good but if i were to call next

00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:16,059
to get to that yield statement and

00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:18,249
instead of calling next again what's

00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:20,470
this function called throw what should I

00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:24,549
throw a 0 division error yeah let's

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:26,319
pretend you / 0 so you'll notice above

00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,849
the stop iteration we have this nice try

00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:32,009
that's because we hit the accept block

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:33,969
of the generator so that's good fun

00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:37,989
another thing that you might not be

00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:40,299
aware of in Python 3.4 is that 3.3 and

00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:42,819
3.4 is that you can actually return

00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:44,859
things from generators that's odd but if

00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:46,630
I create if I call that function that

00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,910
hasn't returned eight it's returned

00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,559
generator I'm so the way that this works

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,539
is when you call next on it enough times

00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,309
the stop iteration actually has this

00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,229
eight on it that's the value I've

00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:58,390
returned how bizarre what's that

00:39:56,229 --> 00:40:00,180
actually useful for I'm glad you asked

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,430
so there's a thing called a sink I oh

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,140
this is something that I those who came

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,579
to my talk will have seen I'm not going

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,170
to run this but you see it's actually

00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,430
useful to be able to yield things as

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,559
well as returning things from the same

00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,059
function and no talk about generators

00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:14,380
would be complete without some things

00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:17,499
that you should not do with generators

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,839
so you are probably aware that this

00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:22,569
gives you a generator okay fair enough

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,489
what would happen are you and I can call

00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,869
list on that to get the elements that

00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,609
that's going to generate what would

00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,769
happen if I actually put yield in there

00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:33,080
since you lose an expression I'm glad

00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:35,630
you asked well oh look I have

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:42,260
nuns in my result so what's happening

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:44,930
here is that we are yielding we were

00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,520
yielding to x 1 then yield is returning

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,980
none which is returned from my generator

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,170
then we're yielding to x 2 then yield is

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,660
returning none then we're yielding to x

00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,220
4 and yield is returning man that's

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,270
strange I don't really want nuns in my

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,980
list so I'm going to get rid of these

00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,170
nuns in my list by putting or seven in

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:03,380
there I look now we've got sevens in my

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,130
list um what else could I do with this

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,750
one or minus X yeah that looks like fun

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,660
so that's something that you should

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:17,570
never do with generators and i think

00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:19,760
i'll invite work there ok so i have two

00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,770
more prizes to give away one book from

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,550
o'reilly media and one book from two

00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:31,240
scoops press is sucky a tour in here

00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:36,320
stir wave if you're here nope thomas

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,330
fantastic Jeff me is fantastic come on

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,950
down and grab a book now we're going to

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,110
go through our sport leaders who

00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,660
basically get 30 seconds each to

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:49,010
introduce their projects Russell your

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,480
time starts now we got there we go okay

00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,640
I'm actually going to be sprinting on

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,430
two things effectively one esme with my

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,090
hat on as a django core developer django

00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:01,070
1.7 is almost there Simon Simon Andrew

00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,200
Godwin is currently napping but he will

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,550
is the release manager for 1.7 and he

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,730
will be working furiously to make sure

00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,900
that Django 1.7 gets out and has a few

00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,040
bugs as possible so if you want to help

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,240
with that process there's plenty of

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,340
things you can do even if you're not

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:18,680
deep into the weeds of the 1.7 process

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,850
there is also one toko which I next you

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,760
can line up so I'll get these going

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:25,100
through quickly i am sam i will be

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,460
sprinting on the salt project which for

00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,260
anyone who does servers is the busiest

00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:34,130
python project on github that doesn't

00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,200
involve you actually seeing anything on

00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,750
top of that i am shaving my personal yak

00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,360
much like russell is and that is a need

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,850
testing tool so i'll be there doing

00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,670
those great next

00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,320
hello my name is Indra who's printing on

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:52,910
the jonathan project because I'd like to

00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:54,530
get it up to 2.7 I would like to if

00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,290
you're stuck using java at work and

00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,210
would prefer to use jathan instead join

00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,160
me if you have Stockholm Syndrome and

00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:06,710
would like to use a JVM please join me

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:09,350
as well next Nick so are we sprinting on

00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,700
C Python anybody who is interested in C

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,110
pathankot development whether you're a

00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,490
seat programmer who'd like to see site

00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,520
or Python programmers for the standard

00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,500
library talk to me at the friends and

00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,480
also packaging Python dog is a huge

00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,950
documentation project a whole lot of it

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,740
at the moment is just a skeleton and

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,300
with maybe with some bullet points that

00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,880
it really needs a lot of fleshing out

00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,530
and we have a real expert blinding this

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,330
problem with that one we've been doing

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:38,810
this stuff for years we think it makes

00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:41,450
sense one next hi I med RP are offering

00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,680
help with porting to python 3 so if

00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,540
you'd like to port anything open-source

00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,000
25 and 3 then come along and we can all

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,670
are sort of um yeah help each other and

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,210
learn from that okay thanks fantastic

00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:55,010
next hi I'm Ryan I'm working on a

00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,840
JavaScript back in for pipeline which I

00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,430
presented about earlier if you've ever

00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,900
wanted to run Python or something quite

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,730
and related on the web maybe we can hack

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,530
on it together come along if you've ever

00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,790
wanted to get into pi PI and like hey

00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,350
I'd love to hack on some language stuff

00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,180
but it sounds really scary pi PI makes

00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:12,610
it really easy and I'd love to help you

00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:15,200
get started in that so come along next

00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,360
hi my name is Brianna I'm going to be

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,830
doing some work on pi test which is an

00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,470
excellent testing library that you

00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:23,990
should probably use and I'm going to

00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:26,510
have a bit of a look at sify i recently

00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,640
filed a bug on syfy for something really

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,080
trivial and they were really excited and

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,490
got back to me really fast so I think

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,320
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit and

00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,330
they'd be really keen to get

00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,080
contributions if you are using numpy and

00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,320
sci-fi could be a good place to start

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:44,040
fantastic next

00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,660
hello I'm Chris I've developed easy

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,640
thumbnails which I'm sure a lot of you

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,670
have used or sold thumbnails I helped

00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,720
out with a lot of it project as well so

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,160
starting it from scratch again because

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,110
it's a fun thing to do so if you'd like

00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:00,840
to see a even better implementation of

00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:03,390
that then talk to me next hi my name is

00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,340
Anita and I work on OpenStack and

00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,490
there's a number of heat of us here are

00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,100
going to be gathering we haven't exactly

00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,020
talked about all the things that we want

00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,080
to sprint on we're just gonna agreed

00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,720
together personally I'm going to be

00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,260
working on changing comments in our

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,420
tempest test suite back to docstrings so

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,570
any that's very low hanging fruit for
