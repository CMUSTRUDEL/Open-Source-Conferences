Description: 
	Modern Python developers depend on a large number of 3rd party packages. This in turn introduces a problem: how to manage those packages for rapid, reliable deployment in a world where the central repository - PyPi (the Cheese Shop) - is out of their control. Additionally, private packages may be developed which need to seamlessly be integrated into the deployment systems.

In this talk I will present devpi, a PyPI (Cheese Shop) server and packaging/testing/release tool. I will cover its reasons for existing, its many capabilities and configuration for some common scenarios.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
