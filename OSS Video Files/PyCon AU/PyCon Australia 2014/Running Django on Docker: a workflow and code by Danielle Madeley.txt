Title: Running Django on Docker: a workflow and code by Danielle Madeley
Publication date: 2014-08-05
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	Docker (http://docker.io) is the hot-new-thing out there for running your application in development and in production. Here at Infoxchange, we are extremely excited about how Docker allows a build-once, run-anywhere approach to moving applications from testing through to production. We are one of the first organisations to be using Docker in production on high-SLA applications.

In this talk we will present:

- a quick intro to Docker and how it solves our problems at Infoxchange;
- our interface for hosting applications on Docker ("pallet");
- how to build and develop a Python app on Docker;
- Infoxchange's Django settings module for the pallet interface;
- Forklift (https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift), a tool we've developed for running and developing apps that use the pallet interface, in and out of a Docker container; and
- Extending forklift for your services.

If time permits we will try and cover the additional bonus topics:

- How to host your legacy mod_python application on Apache inside Docker with minimal changes; and
- Using Forklift to do automated full-stack integration testing of apps by spinning up containers of other apps (which we do in a container that is testing the built app that is running in a container that is our CI server... inception is possible).

The talk will be presented by Danielle Madeley and Alexey Kotlyarov.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
