Description: 
	In 2013 I purchased a Ninja Block (http://ninjablocks.com/) and wanted to add a camera based sensor to it. So began my adventures in computer vision using python. The talk will discuss the various libraries (including PyOpenCV & SimpleCV ) available for python to perform CV tasks like motion detection, object tracking & facial recognition. As my goals for the camera sensor underwent "feature creep" the project required it's own dedicated processing power, so a BeagleBone Black & later a Raspberry Pi were purchased and the project became a IoT device. I will also share my experiences with developing python CV solutions ARM based computers. If the demo gods are willing, code examples will be demonstrated.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
