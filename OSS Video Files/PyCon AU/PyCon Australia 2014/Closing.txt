good evening everyone so this is not

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,170
quite the end of the conference but it's

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,720
the end of the official part of the

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,010
conference I suppose we've still got a

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,600
lot of things happening over the next

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,910
few days and I hope you join us for

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:39,710
those but we have a few things we'd like

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:42,230
to say just in passing so it's it's kind

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,350
of it's kind of the end of the official

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:52,570
path of the conference so we have to say

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:56,329
the official announcements we try to

00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:59,149
keep pycon Australia accessible to as

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,090
many people as possible from as many

00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,379
diverse backgrounds as possible we

00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,180
wouldn't be able to run the conference

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,950
to the standards that we do without the

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,750
help of our professional ticket holders

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:14,740

all the stuff that conference needs to

00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,340
do in order to run but they do it in

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,250
such a way that I don't have to do it

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,140
every year and if you're interested in

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,849
running an open source conference there

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,500
are a couple of Linux Australia folks

00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:12,299
here and they're good people too to get

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,220
in contact with so making our conference

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,319
accessible to a diverse variety of

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,409
attendees is one of the defining points

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,780
of our community this includes diversity

00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,430
of economic backgrounds this year we

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,439
have offered upwards of ten thousand

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,060
dollars in financial assistance to

00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,120
delegates who could not otherwise afford

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,010
to attend in particular we'd like to

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,989
thank eventbrite New Relic and the

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,489
Python software foundation for donating

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,450
sponsor tickets to our financial

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,450
assistance pool

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,940
park on Australia so parkland Australia

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,040
is not the only Python or open source

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,860
software event taking place in the next

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,840
12 months or so linux australia runs a

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,210
lot of events a lot of other groups run

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
a lot of open source events and we just

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,350
want to run over a few of those that you

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,430
might be interested now so we have the

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,720

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,030
registration is now open it starts

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,200
tomorrow so I guess maybe you could do

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,870
that at the sprints yeah and you know

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,810
we've seen from our first keynote the

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,290
awesome work that is going on there so

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,580
I'd encourage I'd encourage anyone who's

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,200
got high school students are interested

in this sort of stuff to pop along to

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,760

ended that the conference will be

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:34,120
gearing up very shortly this is one that

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:41,270
I attended earlier this year Pikkon in

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,720
America Canada specifically America

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:52,830
versus the USA folks are the age 26 of

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:56,940
April yeah so sometime like four

00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:01,410
a half thousand people okay way too many

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,910
people for me this thing's never going

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:08,340
to get that big it won't happen I won't

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:10,710
let it so financial assistance is

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,750
available so if you would like to get

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,220
along and you think you think that

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,650
you'll get something out of it they have

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,710
an enormous financial assistance program

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,680
available put your name in the ring and

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,820
you never know what's going to happen so

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,740
here in Brisbane we have a couple of

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,830
years of grapes that have been really

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,790
important to making this event happen

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:37,950
we've got humbug which is our small typo

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,040
in the slides there it's a local UNIX

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:45,720
group which means more than Linux these

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,730
days all of the local organizers are

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,580
from humbug that's that's where the idea

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:55,320
for running this event came from we meet

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,260
fortnightly at UQ we are quite an active

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,990
group we do a lot of things we organise

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,990
far too many conferences for my liking

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,000
and yeah we're there for people who want

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,810
to learn how to do stuff with open

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,850
source tools Brisbois which is a much

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,110
smaller conference that I organized on a

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,940
fortnightly basis we have a special

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,190
meeting since we're all here we've got a

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,630
special meeting tomorrow night during

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:29,040
the spins at the evening so head along

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:34,920
too medicom look for the brisbane python

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:37,440
user group and sign up for that there

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,790
are other years agrees nationwide so for

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,760
those that have traveled from sydney

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,700
melbourne and perth you have some quiet

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,470
goods user groups i'm on all of the

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,940
mailing lists and they're quite active

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,090
and i have quite interesting talks all

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,090
the time

00:07:52,510 --> 00:08:01,090
so there's still more stuff to go after

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,910
the official stuff so tomorrow we've got

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,360
the sprints we've got two days of

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,540
sprints they're in this building but in

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,140
another room so right to the top of the

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:16,420
the building in s1 so we're expecting

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:21,880
about 100 people on Monday and about 80

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:27,460
people on Tuesday videos are being

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:29,890
encoded as we speak so barring anything

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,950
that I don't know about I think that

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,840
every talk has been successfully

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,060
recorded and is now being encoded and

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,620
uploaded so they'll be up in the next

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,200
couple of days and that is the youtube

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,540
account that Dudley available from and I

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,570
would like to give just a quick shout

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,470
out to my video team he's done an

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,470
enormous amount of work

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:11,540
so when when you put a bid in for hike

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,370
on to run Paco and Australia the way

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,140
that we're currently doing that is that

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,560
you put a bit in for two years in a row

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,180
and the idea is that the the first year

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,890
it crushes you and then the next year

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:30,230
you crush it so so we are going to be

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,060
doing it again in Brisbane next year

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:37,880
roughly the same time roughly the same

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:39,560
place we hope and I'd like to bring on

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,240
Chris now who's the Linux Australia

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,150
representative and he'll be the one who

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,640
will help decide the bids yes so we we

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,340
have another year here in in Brisbane

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,140
next year but currently we do not have a

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,490
host city for 2016 and 2017 and we'd

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,510
really like for this conference to

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,790
continue on so with that in mind if you

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,340
are from city in australia there's quite

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,440
a few that we hadn't been to yes

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,460
melbourne would be fantastic canberra

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,860
adelaide any of those if you know people

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:21,020
are form a group perhaps Perth as well

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,780
yay it's quite a few of your here on I'm

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,790
sorry for missing you out perhaps you

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,500
don't know some people if you don't know

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:32,060
people who might perhaps form a group

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,010
are send an email to contact at PyCon au

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,200
org and we can perhaps introduce you to

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,810
some people are to help form a big team

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,150
in your home city myself and Richard

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,040

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,250
about running a bike on australia we

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,130
think this is a great event to run and

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,470
we'd love to see as many expressions of

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,570
interest as possible so we can get the

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,300
best possible a continuation of this

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,790
conference and back to you clinton i

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,860
just like to add to that that there's a

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,340
lot of experience people who've run poke

into the void and to run an event any

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,710
questions that you've got they'll be

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:26,700
able to answer it so you are not on your

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:27,900
own but in any way shape or form so you

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,570
know you're running this sort of event

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,710
and there are a ton of people who do a

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,870
lot of work which make event possible

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:40,500
and I've got a few special shoutouts to

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,060
a few people and you know if you're not

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,830
on this list it doesn't mean you haven't

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:52,800
worked your butt off it just means that

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:56,400
after cotton nicole harris from kabul

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,640
creative nicole is a graphics and design

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,020
person the the reason that the website

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,660
looks as good as it does and the

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,960
graphics are consistent is all down to

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,810
Nicole Nicole unfortunately couldn't

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,760
make the conference so we wanted to give

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,180
her a special shout-out she has been

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,830
absolutely fantastic to work with really

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,490
quick turnaround time and all the

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:26,850
graphics requests I worked with her on a

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:28,860
a on the the colonel model of putting in

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,900
a bad patch and letting someone else get

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,180
disgusted by and fix it so i upload my

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:37,800
crappy graphics and she would fix it up

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:40,710
beautifully instantly so nicole has been

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,990
absolutely a foundation element of this

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,940
conference and it's a great pity that

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,960
you couldn't be here for it so just like

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,960
Teva a quick round of applause

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:59,040
our cape and neil davenport they have

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:03,959
been designing our awesome t-shirts

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,610
since 2011 and we like the t-shirt

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,860
sloshed and we want to keep that sort of

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,980
consistent look going so we're hoping to

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,949
keep them on we've kept some of the

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,339
t-shirts aside for them as a bit of a

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:26,639
small gift but we really like their work

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:29,339
so thank you very much for that and and

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,410
there are folks out there who will run a

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,660
little conference they're too clever to

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,290
run over full-size conference so they'll

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,389
run a mini conf so django con where was

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,629
round by russell the science and data

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:44,339
mini cough was ed and Graham and the

00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:47,489
OpenStack conference was Joshua and

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,399
Robert now they had to deal with a

00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:52,410
fairly grumpy conference organizer and

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,170
they made to keep their cool much better

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,119
than I kept my cool they've pulled up

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,889
some great talks there was a lot of

00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,439
really good content that I saw going by

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,939
in the live stream and I really hope

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,669
that we get to see those many counts

00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:07,999
again so I'd really like to give them

00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,999
thanks

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:22,950
so Richard Jones and the program

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:24,900
committee so like a big chunk of

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,870
organizing the conference is done by

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,180
these guys you get your website set up

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,190
so that you can accept submissions you

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,970
hand them off to Richard and a couple of

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:48,360
weeks later you come back with a program

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:51,800
couldn't be easier and yeah so we've got

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,940
we've got a paper committee that we keep

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,300
we keep the same members from year to

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,580
year as much as possible it means that

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,140
we know who the good speakers are we

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,730
know who the possibly not so good

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,180
speakers are so we've got some some

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,550
record of that we know what to look for

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,380
in a good talk we know what levels up

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,360
sorry went on saying we I'm staying the

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,610
program would eat not me the program

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,170
committee knows what papers are going to

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,130
be good papers who are the good

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,810
presenters this year we've had almost a

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,500
hundred submissions and they needed to

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:28,830
fit into just 40 slots so there's a lot

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,140
of there's a lot of our ji bhaji with

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,520
that and looking at them looking at all

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,870
the submissions from different angles

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:40,140
and trying to work out which of those is

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:43,530
best so yeah but a big thank you to the

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,610
entire program committee because they

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:50,220
made probably one of the toughest jobs

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,750
of running the conference and I hope I

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,060
gave them one input and I got one output

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,240
and it was smooth as silk so thanks very

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,240
much

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:07,709
volunteers so the inspire conference is

00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:10,680
run by volunteers having said that

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:16,410
though there are certain volunteers who

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:22,110
come on board and they're given specific

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:23,879
small tasks and one of my one of one of

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,189
the things that I care greatly about is

00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,790
looking after the volunteers making sure

00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:32,100
that they're not asked to do anything

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,269
more than we've requested of them making

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,379
sure that they're not asked to do

00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,839
something that we haven't trained them

00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,990
out in not putting them in uncomfortable

00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:44,069
positions and and that for me is really

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,850
important and and this year we have had

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:49,170
a bunch of volunteers come in do the

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,019
jobs that were requested of them and

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,850
then really step up and offer so much

00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:59,939
more to the conference than we ever

00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:01,709
asked of them so Kim and Lee for

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:12,419
stepping up way beyond what they are

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:14,069
asked for with the AV team 10 McKenzie

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,779
who was a diversity officer who

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:20,159
unfortunately couldn't make it to the

00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,839
weekend event but she did a lot of work

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:26,760
making sure that our conference is

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,649
versus as it currently is lockland for

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,990
being a champion organizer of the

00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:32,549
electronics workshop I pretty much dump

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,500
some electronics on his desk the day

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,809
before the workshop and we had the

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,789
following day a workshop and I'd also

00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,890
like to thank energy over who is the

00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:43,610
facilitator on the day for that and I

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,610
will both awesome

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,090
and the Stuart's this is this is where

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,870
things get a little bit more difficult

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:59,030
so we have three Stuart's in the

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,030
organizing committee and if I've got one

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,530
suggestion for future years don't have

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,220
that many family members in the

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,170
organizing group so we have we have

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,370
Russell Stewart who is my second in

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,770
charge and he is a numbers men primarily

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,780
and he keeps me in line we have Sheryl

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,600
Stewart his wife and she has been

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,430
running the reg odesk and we have Ryan

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,920
who's our volunteers coordinator now

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:31,460
those three have been a little bit iffy

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,860
at certain times but all three of them

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,630
together makes things run really

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:45,230
smoothly so I'd like to think like to

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:47,240
thank that triumphant if I could now it

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,400
goes without saying that that this is

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,130
that undertaking a conference of this

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,890
size is is quite a strain on the time

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:58,850
that you have it's a really hard job

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:01,280
it's often thankless and this year we

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,830
have one person who really stepped up to

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,020
help make this this whole event happen

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,370
and that is Clinton Roy I could you

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,370
please join me in thanking him

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,710
where's Russell

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,539

00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,369

00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,739

00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:56,309

conference thank you all for coming I

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,980
hope you've had a good time I hope

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,809
you've made use of the suggestion box if

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,470
you come up with any ideas for how we

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,549
can improve things and things we can add

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,539
apart from being more organized that's

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:14,190
kind of a general thing we're really

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,899
good up until about four weeks out and

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,239
then I kind of collectively lost my

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:23,999
basket so except for the Sprint's

00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:25,919
