	As Alex Martelli eloquently pointed out at PyCon US 2013, when it comes to shipping software in a timely fashion, "good enough" often really is good enough. Nick Coghlan sets out to illustrate this point by taking a tour through some of the elegant and ugly hacks to be found in the CPython interpreter and the Python standard library.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
