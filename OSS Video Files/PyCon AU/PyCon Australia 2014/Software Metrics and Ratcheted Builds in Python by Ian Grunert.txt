Description: 
	The JIRA team automates it's Java build system across development and build systems.

To help scale a small Engineering Health team across a team of 60+ full time developers and growing, we built a engineering metrics system in Python. This consists of a source code scanner, custom metrics generator, as well as a ratcheted build system written in Python using git-notes as a storage mechanism.

By storing the data in git-notes, the data follows the repository which makes it extremely simple and flexible.

In this talk we'll cover how we've used core python features to build these command line tools, the overall architecture of the system, and some tips around introducing Python into your build process.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
