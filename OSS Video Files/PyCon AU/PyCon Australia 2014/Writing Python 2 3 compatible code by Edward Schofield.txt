Title: Writing Python 2 3 compatible code by Edward Schofield
Publication date: 2014-08-18
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	Python 3 was never intended to be compatible with Python 2. Freed from the shackles of backward compatibility, Python's core developers took the liberty of creating a language that "really hadn't changed all that much" [Python 3.0 release notes] -- except that it was almost impossible to write a non-trivial program that ran on both major versions. These days the situation is still not perfect, but it is getting better, thanks to compatibility features at the language level and with libraries like Six and Python-Future.

Come and learn what Python 3 is all about and how to write clean, modern, mostly idiomatic Python 3 code that runs on both Python 2 and Python 3. What are the risks and caveats with porting? Is it even possible for you? What are the best approaches? Will it be worth the effort?

This presentation will be a clear, step-by-step walk-through that aims to change the way you write Python.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
