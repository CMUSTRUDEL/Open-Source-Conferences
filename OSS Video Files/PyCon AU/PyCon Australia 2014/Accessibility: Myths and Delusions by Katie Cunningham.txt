keynote presenter is one of the true

00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,250
champions of diversity in the Python

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,109
community as a leader of Pi ladies DC

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,910
community she plays an active role in

00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:17,710
making Python accessible to an

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,000
increasing number of women across the

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,279
Washington DC area

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,439
she also co-founded the young coders

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,269
workshops that have since taken place at

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,159
many international Python conferences

00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:28,869
offering an opportunity for young

00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:31,689
children to discover and develop an

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:33,370
interest in programming Katie is an

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,890
author of two books including the

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,360
O'Reilly accessibility handbook today

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,780
she'll be teaching us about the myths

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,880
and delusions of accessibility questions

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:52,270
at the end please welcome Katie

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:54,430
Cunningham hello everyone thank you for

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,550
the intro as he said I'm Katie

00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,900
Cunningham I work at Cox Media Group in

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:04,239
the US and this is the book I wrote

00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,040
accessibility handbook I wrote it

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,060
because there weren't any books that

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:15,220
really took a usability perspective on

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,380
accessibility I got into the field out

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,020
of accessibility mostly out of

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,970
frustration I used to get I used to work

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,070
at NASA and when you work for the

00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,920
federal government in the US every

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,580
single application and app you push out

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,290
has to be accessible to everyone and

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,080
this kept tripping us up because it's

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,659
the last check as we would move out and

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,340
like go to deploy our application the

00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,049
group the accessibility group would look

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,810
over our application with a fine-tooth

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:47,979
comb and they would send it back to us

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,510
every single time and we would ask you

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:52,900
know what do we need to change ok you

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,880
need to change this why I don't have

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,190
time to educate you I've got 20 other

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,530
apps I've got to look at you've just

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,659
just told just do what I said and fix it

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,310
please and there were times that we

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,960
would fix it send it back and they'd

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,880
find something new and we never

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,890
understood why this happened we just

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,450
thought they hated us oh I think they

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:14,620
did a little bit but they didn't hate us

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,780
for the reasons we thought so one day we

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,160
had a lull the customer hadn't signed

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,770
off on anything new

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,150
they still had to pay us so we sat

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,920
around and decided to learn about

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,920
accessibility because we were really

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,930
tired of having our applications blocked

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:34,720
it turned out to be a really fascinating

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:37,030
field it was full of much more you know

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,300
diversity than we'd expected it was much

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,670
more interesting than we had expected it

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,490
was much more subtle than any of us had

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,990
expected now as a result we learned

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,210
about accessibility spent like you know

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,580
a couple weeks just really talking about

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,630
it reading resources finding resources

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:58,090
and as a result once we did that our

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,220
applications all of a sudden were

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,620
passing 508 like they might find one

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,540
minor thing but it was kind of the thing

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,790
where we would go oh I know it's changed

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,830
and you'd run back change it change the

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,590
template upload it again and we'd pass

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,360
before they often had to give us two to

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,340
three weeks more weeks on our

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,710
development cycle which nobody wants so

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,440
a quick definition of what accessibility

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,180
is though there's no shortage of

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,270
definitions if you go on the internet

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,950
and just ask what is accessibility but

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,740
all of them pretty much boil down to

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,920
this all the data and all the

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,390
functionality for all the people so if

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,209
it's on your website as a piece of

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,010
information that can be consumed

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,520
everybody should be able to access it if

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,220
it's a function that like creating a new

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,000
line in a spreadsheet or adding a record

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,770
or you know playing a song that also

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,630
needs to be accessible to all the people

00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:02,620
that's what accessibility is about

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:06,480
that's why we access see that's why

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,480
access is in the name

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,290
so what do I mean when I talk about

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,720
myths and delusions I talk to people all

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,150
the time about accessibility and there's

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,459
two themes that keep popping up

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,560
the first is myths and this is where

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,410
people are just it's been misinformed

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,389
about what accessibility is and that's

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,310
usually pretty easy to overcome you can

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,730
correct them and they're usually more

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,669
than happy to go on their way

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,800
delusions are the lies we tell ourselves

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,470
if we examine them for just more than a

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,180
minute we would realize we're deleting

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,520
ourselves because we don't want to work

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,770
any harder we don't want to think any

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,290
harder we want to stay in our little

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:54,890
sphere where everybody's body works

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:57,110
perfectly so the first myth it's just

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:00,650
about blind people right I get this one

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,630
a lot many people focus so much on

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,090
screen readers they forget everybody

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,190
else that accessibility covers it's not

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,180
just about blind people when I talk

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,100
about accessibility

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,760
I'm usually referring to five groups of

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:18,320
people like five individual groups now

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,240
the first is blind people and this is

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,440
anybody that uses a screen reader to

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,060
access their application now yes you

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,180
know we do talk about the blind quite a

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,300
bit but computers and the Internet are a

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,280
visual medium and people that are blind

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,560
have to use a screen reader a completely

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,800
different application to access that

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,979
data so yeah we do talk about them quite

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,370
a bit but they're not all there is

00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:48,710
though next up is the visually disabled

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,630
these are people that no matter what you

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,970
do to their eyeballs what glass you put

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,680
in front of it what you know lasers you

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,520
shoot into it they're never going to

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,690
have like 2060 or 20/80 vision they will

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,050
never and these are people that can

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,160
correct a 20/20 this is when 2020 is a

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,830
pipe dream they will never have it this

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,530
also includes I also include people who

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,900
are color blind in this category because

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,780
if many people use color on their

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,700
websites to indicate information so you

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,340
might have a graph where it says okay

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,500
red you know this one is you know how

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,530
many people like like you know

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,620
sandwiches how many people like you know

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,230
cake that kind of thing or intensity

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,640
like how strong of an effect are we

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:40,920
talking about how many koalas are in

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,560
this County versus what do you what do

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,020
you call them States States

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,640
how many koalas are in this state versus

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,690
this day I'm trying to localize this for

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,360
you so you'll understand if you use

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,340
colors that a colorblind person can't

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,800
tell the difference between or one looks

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,390
more intense than the other then you

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:08,820
they have a problem accessing that

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:10,530
information oh it's very time when Apple

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,170
first came out with the iPhone

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,500
you could go on their website and look

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,960
up a store and see how it like do they

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,940
have the iPhone yet and they had you

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,370
know they you there yes they have them

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,370
no they were out and it looked like this

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,970
so people know where this is going so

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,490
yeah so red meant that they had no

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,470
rifles left green meant they had some

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,660
left now this is what somebody who has

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,280
red-green color blindness what it looks

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,950
like

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,390
thanks Apple it's great I mean this is

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,100
kind of a lesson that we sometimes think

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,680
that you know big companies would never

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,020
make make a such a simple mistake as

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,450
this and they totally did now to their

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,170
credit when they it was caught

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,540
they had it fixed so it was one of my

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,190
co-workers noticed this and he took the

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,920
screenshot in like two hours later it

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,690
was fixed but even big companies can

00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,790
make this simple of a mistake moving on

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,020
we have the hearing disabled this not

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,700
only includes people in the deaf

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,920
community but people have partial

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,810
hearing loss partial hearing loss is

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,340
kind of misunderstood because people see

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,220
a hearing aid and they're like oh you're

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,500
cool you're fixed and that's not

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,280
necessarily the case if you're missing

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,409
certain sounds no amplification can

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,259
bring those sounds to your ear

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:35,729
and what's funny is people think that oh

00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,800
they just don't hear those sounds like

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,779
it would be like a record popping but

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,490
your brain is super smart so what it

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,779
does is it back fills those sounds so

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,269
you hear this cloud of clear sounds and

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,129
not clear sounds if you ever if you know

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,920
anybody who complains that everybody

00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,740
around them mumbles they probably have

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,209
hearing loss because it's not like your

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,790
hearing is going away and getting

00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:03,899
quieter you lose chunks of it because of

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:06,449
the way your ear works we also have the

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,819
physically disabled these are people who

00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:11,699
they may have trouble moving they may

00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:13,980
have lost movement you might have people

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:16,259
who have very shaky and jerky movement

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,879
some of these people can only use a

00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:22,199
keyboard some of them can only use a

00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,029
mouse some of them just need more time

00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,199
sometimes it's a pain issue people with

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,199
arthritis

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:31,649
you know our injuries might be limited

00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:32,970
to how long they can do something a lot

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,259
of people thought rightis have trouble

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,630
with games where you have to hold a

00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,449
mouse for too long because your hand

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,980
starts to really hurt after a while so

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,740
you know if you're playing a game you

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,170
know okay but if you're playing if

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,180
you're like trying to do your taxes in

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,709
the US and you use certain sites they

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,680
give you like 30 minutes to get to the

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:57,180
stupid form and that's really hard if

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,519
you have motion issues finally we have

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,630
the cognitively disabled and this is

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,209
more than people with intellectual

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,250
disabilities this also includes people

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:10,230
with information processing disabilities

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:13,019
like dyslexia and a DD or ADHD most

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,120
people think of dyslexia 88a DD and ADHD

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,980
about you know either it's a vision

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,269
issue or it's an attention issue but

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,660
it's really not it's about how your

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,639
brain is processing information now what

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,250
are computers really good at but

00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,540
spitting out a ton of information you

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,050
can see where this would start to become

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,050
a problem

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:37,649
so first delusion I don't have any

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:41,250
disabled users I've had people say this

00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:43,230
to me and it's one of those ones it gets

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,850
me really riled up don't say it to me

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,069
when I've had like a few Bourbons

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,290
because I did almost get kicked out of a

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:53,040
bar at PyCon forgetting you've got a guy

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:55,560
over this so according to the Australian

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,959
Network for disability there are 4

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,889
million people in Australia who have a

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,170
disability that's one in five that's

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,990
twice the population of Brisbane

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:11,850
according to our little pamphlet but

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:14,880
you're actually red so if your site has

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,500
more than a dozen users chances are very

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,560
good that you've had somebody with a

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,399
disability on your website so let's

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,660
break it down 3.4 million is true

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,240
Australians have a physical disability

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:32,040
some of these may impact computer use

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:36,389
some may not one in six has some form of

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,620
hearing loss around 600,000 people in

00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,810
Australia have some form of

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:47,459
developmental disability 10% of the

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:49,829
population has dyslexia 1% is on the

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:54,240
autistic spectrum which also impacts how

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:56,610
they take in information 5 to 10% of the

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,199
population of Australia has a DD or ADHD

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:05,790
and one in 10 men in Australia are color

00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:08,939
blind now you may be wondering why these

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,290
numbers don't seem to add up if you add

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,240
them up and they go back real fast if

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,089
you add them up you're like that's

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,740
doesn't quite what are the cut one of

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,420
the great things about having a

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,370
disability is that you often don't just

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,339
get one many people who have

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,680
disabilities have multiple which is why

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,779
you also can't forget a group or think

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,759
they're not important because chances

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,699
are somebody who has hearing light

00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,139
hearing loss might also have vision loss

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,970
somebody with motion disorder might also

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,269
have an intellectual disability or a

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,160
cognitive disorder now if you look

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,569
around you might say I don't see that

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,370
many disabled people there were that

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,720
many disabled people and I would have I

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,910
would have figured this out a long time

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,199
ago

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,449
90% of all disabilities are considered

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,930
invisible meaning they're not in the

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,149
wheelchair

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,160
there is no cane there's nothing to

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,430
indicate that this person has a

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,430
disability

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,910
it's a myth it's just the US right

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,860
that's that 508 thing we call it 508 in

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,600
the US because that's the bill number

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,750
and what we're super boring like that

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,680
and we'll call everything by a number so

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:17,560
it's not just the u.s. actually most

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,350
countries have a mandate about

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,149
accessibility in Australia it is a

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,370
federal requirement the government

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,529
websites be accessible to all people no

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,230
matter how they're accessing it or what

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:32,589
disability they have in Australia that

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,040
means you follow the W wcag 2.0

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:38,380
requirements that were set up by the w3c

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,089
now that is just for government websites

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,820
which most people in this room probably

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:45,459
do not build but that doesn't mean

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,250
you'll never need to be accessible in

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,050
the US several large corporations have

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,160
been taken to court over inaccessible

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,920
websites the law that was used was not

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,500
the law about accessible websites it was

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,910
the one about physical access to

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,890
buildings and the logic was you have

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,860
this website you also have a physical

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,329
building you could no more block me from

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,089
getting into your building if it's a

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,529
public what public place then you could

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:18,940
then I should be able to access your

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:20,829
website because it is also public all of

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,170
these were settled out of court

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:25,630
target was one of them I think Walmart

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,610
got hit too they were all settled out of

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,959
court so there's not officially any case

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:34,480
law in you know in America but it's

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,459
coming it's getting harder and harder

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,990
for these places to dodge and it's

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,180
becoming more and more likely that at

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,800
some point somebody's gonna say I'm not

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,209
going to take an out-of-court settlement

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,270
and we are taking this all the way to

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,620
the Supreme Court you know and once it

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,560
happens in America in a few other

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,950
countries it really rapidly happens in

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,070
all other countries when 508 standards

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,720
hit the US if you look at when they hit

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,970
other countries it was within a few

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,070
years all of a sudden these standards

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:08,740
went up and they all mirror each other

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,889
very closely another delusion I can't

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,019
afford it

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,699
I got this one all the time and I once

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,100
had somebody tell me that he couldn't

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,499
possibly be accessible because he would

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,829
have to double his development budget

00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:25,040
and my response was like what kind of

00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,290
crap app have you built you know

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,019
seriously some alt text is gonna kill

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,199
you you can't caption your videos I mean

00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:35,329
I priced captioning videos for a project

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,699
I was on it's not that expensive you can

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,819
totally outsource that and have somebody

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,649
captioned your videos for you you know a

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:46,249
lot of this stuff it's not that

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:51,879
expensive so if that murders your budget

00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:56,809
you spent nothing on development this

00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:59,569
there's a checklist right I get this

00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,399
question all the time people asked me

00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:03,829
for a checklist that they can use to

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,509
make their site accessible so they want

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,129
a list that they can just check off all

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:09,249
the items and once everything's checked

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,069
off their site is perfectly accessible

00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:15,769
I'm like okay I'll give you a deal I'll

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,720
give you that checklist as soon as you

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,730
give me a checklist when I check off

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,779
everything on that list my side is

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,939
totally usable and Freddie or my codes

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,699
really clear and well-maintained you

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:30,279
know what's the checklist for nobody is

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,079
going to hate me for this code later

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,509
you know what's the words checklist for

00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,720
this will make me money usually this is

00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:40,759
something you learn through experience

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:45,649
the problem is is that a checklist is

00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:48,529
not a tool for a novice a checklist is a

00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,470
tool for an expert to communicate but

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,220
the person who needs to fix the problem

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,169
that's what it's for

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,759
there's a whole lot more thinking that

00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,709
goes behind a checklist like you

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,779
couldn't fly a plane because you have

00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:03,709
the checklist of what you have to fill

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:05,209
out before you take off right okay he

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,649
says okay so don't you've you know

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,669
that's not gonna allow you to fly the

00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:09,669
pen by the plane

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,640
and there are checklists out there so if

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,910
you search for accessibility checklist

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,980
or 508 checklist you will find some but

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:30,020
they're not for you unless you happen to

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:31,970
also be an accessibility person now what

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,500
accessibility boils down to and why you

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,630
can't do a checklist is this right here

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,480
accessibility is usability for a group

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,010
of users who have additional needs

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,420
because there are no usability checklist

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,070
there are no accessibility checklist

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,070
that work the way you think they should

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,470
so delusion technology has solved this

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,000
issue technology's so awesome that

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,350
disabled people are like barely even

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,360
disabled have you seen the people

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,830
running into Special Olympics there are

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,520
faster than people they're like

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,110
superheroes now technology has done

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,330
quite a bit to help those who are

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,429
disabled there are add-ons that tweak

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,080
colors for the colorblind and screen

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:14,030
readers that read out websites and

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,070
keyboards you can use with just one hand

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,710
or you can use it with puffs of air your

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,410
tongue there's a lot of technology out

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:24,200
there that has really improved the lives

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,720
of people who are disabled but it can't

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,179
do it all

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,730
we developers move way faster than the

00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,050
accessibility community can there's not

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,290
that many people working on this

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,580
technology compared to y'all consider

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,440
the fact that I'm one of the few people

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,140
in the Python community that knows about

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,910
this and how many of the how many are

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:50,480
there of us in this community because

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,730
there's so few of us we can't keep up

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,620
you know and we're constantly trying to

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,470
race ahead to try to catch up with what

00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,660
you've done with the latest technology

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,510
we need to be better as developers about

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,670
reaching back so that they don't have is

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:08,890
so that we accessibility people don't

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:12,679
have as far to run trying to catch up I

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:15,010
love this myth oh my god this is another

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,290
one I almost got me kicked out of a bar

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:22,280
flash is totally accessible is a myth

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:23,780
now happily I don't have to have this

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,980
argument as much anymore because flash

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,360
is no longer cool

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:31,309
q Apple it's one of the few things I

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:38,150
will thank you for but it doesn't come

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:41,179
up occasionally flash is not accessible

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:43,070
it just isn't I don't care that they've

00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,809
a very pretty subside about how to make

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,809
accessible flash it's all bs

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,799
it's almost certain that when the flash

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,660
developer was working on whatever they

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,179
were working on they forgot one of those

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,700
groups I outlined earlier they just left

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,650
somebody out I mean even if a screen

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,169
reader can go through and like use your

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,120
app what about somebody who needs to

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,429
change the font people who are severely

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,770
dyslexic often need to change the fonts

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,130
on your website and if they can't do

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,070
that

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,080
they cannot read it what about people

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,140
who need different colors in order to

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,720
see it people who are autistic who have

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,669
dyslexia who have a TD a DD and ADHD

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,799
often change font colors to help them

00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:28,309
concentrate you can't do that in the

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,549
flash app I've yet to run across one

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,290
that is fully 100% accessible and if it

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:39,260
was I would be like why didn't you just

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:40,970
make a stupid website at this point you

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,970
know and as I said I've seen a lot of

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:48,679
flash and not a single one has ever

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:50,600
passed the sniff test so if you happen

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,429
to be in a large organization where they

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,440
have this one little dusty corner and

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,000
there's a stupid flash app you have to

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,760
touch like twice a year and you hate it

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,530
congratulations you now have an excuse

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,510
to can it and redo it how you want

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,910
because you can be like it's not

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:10,700
accessible we should do this so we're

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:12,770
not jerks delusion disabled people are

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,179
experts at being disabled this is

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:22,070
another part of the super you know

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:24,500
Superman myth of the disabled not every

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,260
disabled person though was born disabled

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,540
many people become disabled later in

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,580
life when that happens it can take

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,470
months sometimes even years to be able

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,490
to fully work around their disability

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:41,440
and also not everyone is

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:43,770
disabled so let's do storytime in 1999 I

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,240
was bitten by my iguana my pet iguana

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:51,490
wasn't a tiny iguana it was a five and a

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:54,490
half foot long iguana he bit my hand

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,950
severing four tendons it took 300

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,020
stitches and a year of physical therapy

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,860
to get my hand back to anywhere close to

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:05,380
where it would had been before because

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,380
he had dip it in my dominant hand of

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:12,250
course I couldn't write

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,840
I could barely type like I was down to

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:18,309
ten words a minute from you know

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,290
whatever I was doing before I couldn't

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,390
even sign my name which caused a

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,070
surprising number of problems because

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,630
people would ask me to sign my name so

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,960
I'd have to use my left hand because my

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:31,090
right hand literally didn't move for

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,510
three months and then was like a little

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,950
bit I could move so I would go to sign

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,270
something they would check the back of

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,670
my card this doesn't look like your

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,110
signature like yes I know I was injured

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,970
well it doesn't look like your signature

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,420
I don't think I can let you purchase

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,690
this it's like give me my stupid coffee

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,340
I'm not trying to you know steal and I'm

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,440
like I've injured I'm using the wrong

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,510
hand and there were a lot of things they

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,090
just stopped me like no you can't you

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,340
can't have this I also couldn't drive

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,960
during this time because although I

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,809
don't run the rooms like I Drive with

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,150
one hand all the time in emergency

00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:10,660
situations you need both hands and my

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,670
other hand did not work I I couldn't get

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,320
commands to it the nerves had been fried

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,110
and it took a year to where I could

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,390
actually move my hand again

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:26,140
I couldn't properly like dress myself or

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,230
wash my hair try it one day just wrap up

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,309
a hand and try to get dressed

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,770
fortunately at the time I was in college

00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,360
so I was still at home and my mother was

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,820
helping me get through day to day life

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,890
and she likened it to taking care of

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,890
very large baby that cursed a lot

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:48,049
during this time I had professors who

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,179
were demanding that I still attend class

00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:53,000
and take notes and write papers and take

00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,830
exams and this was back in the old days

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,630
where we didn't get to take them on

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,600
computers where you had to write out

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,070
your essay with your hand that wasn't

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,710
working because the stupid iguana had

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,770
been in it what they didn't understand

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,490
they liked use your other hand and I was

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,400
like you are an

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:15,890
you know and I just I couldn't even take

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,380
notes in class you know I was I would

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,970
try to take notes and they would be on

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,770
to the next topic and I'm still writing

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:28,490
the first sentence I ended up dropping

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,289
out it was very very hard to fight that

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,210
battle when you're just struggling to

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:37,340
get through one day looking back I blame

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,539
myself when I get the test of time and

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,820
now I look back and I'm like they were

00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,380
jerks the least they could have done is

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,799
somebody given somebody to help me write

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,750
notes you know or something but at the

00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,400
time all they saw was a little bandage

00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:55,730
on my hand and they said you must be

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:57,799
fine another myth you can't make iOS and

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,110
Android apps accessible I have good news

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,179
for you here this was one of my most

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,470
pleasant discoveries that I figured that

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,500
I found out as I was studying

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:10,090
accessibility it's actually really easy

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,429
to make accessible iOS and Android apps

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,280
so I was showing a co-worker how to use

00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,500
a screen reader on his Mac and he kept

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,510
forgetting like the keys and he'd get

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,700
lost and thing was like yelling at him

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,870
and he's like stop talking and he'd look

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,710
at the screen even though I said don't

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,270
look at the screen it's just kind of

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,789
confused you should turn it off and he's

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,539
like no it's a big mess he was really

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:31,309
frustrated

00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:32,870
later that afternoon I said well let me

00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,970
show you how to use the accessibility

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,039
features on your phone and he had it in

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,570
under an hour and he actually still uses

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,669
it to listen to blog post while he runs

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,380
they'll start up the screen reader

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,520
started reading put it in his back

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,610
pocket and go for a run smartphones have

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,690
the advantage of being developed after

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,930
accessibility became a mandate in many

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,430
countries

00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,370
governments are big purchasers of

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,140
smartphones so developers behind Android

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,540
and iOS made sure that their

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,540
accessibility features for top-notch and

00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:08,260
easy to develop for browsers haven't

00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,580
been as kind to us also because you're

00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,170
working with a smaller screen the

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,280
interfaces are I hope simpler so I love

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,570
it when somebody comes to me and they

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,430
say can you help me make our mobile

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,740
application accessible I usually have a

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:24,220
really easy job in front of me because

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,200
there's not that much to check so if you

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,130
develop for iOS or Android accessibility

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,430
for those is so easy like you don't even

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,520
have an excuse myth I can't test for

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:39,040
accessibility jaws is expensive okay

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,200
like that the myth part is not Jaws jaws

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,910
is crazy expensive for those who don't

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,020
know jaws is a screen reader for Windows

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:49,720
that you purchase and it's like $900

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,430
American so similar Australia and

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,130
probably now that you all get up charged

00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,110
on stuff like that don't you yeah I

00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:00,340
wasn't deserve a punctuation I know what

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:03,700
I know what's happening so jaws is the

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,310
Cadillac of screen readers if you use it

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,580
to test your website though you don't

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,920
need a caddy really um every major

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,990
operating system out there comes with a

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,480
screen reader these are perfectly

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,160
serviceable screen readers and you know

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,740
they work they work for what you need

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,810
and if you're developing on a Mac or

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,350
Linux you weren't gonna get jaws anyway

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:29,380
because jaws is just for Windows now if

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,850
you do want to test on Windows and you

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,760
don't want to you don't like the Windows

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:38,800
one I highly recommend checking out NVDA

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:41,560
by NV access it is awesome it's free

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:47,190
it's open source and it's written in

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,190
Python yes

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:54,740
this delusion we're gonna write our site

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,380
and we'll total fix it we will totally

00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,890
make it accessible once we're done don't

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,390
you buy to me oh you're not you're never

00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,130
gonna do that you're not gonna come back

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,160
and you know what you shouldn't do it in

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,809
that order anyway you know I get calls

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,240
from people all the time who want to

00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:14,450
make their site accessible and they pull

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,830
me in after the stupid thing is done so

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,230
I have to go through and they've made

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:20,360
some very Smith some mistakes that if I

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,470
pointed out in the beginning it would

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,630
have been no problem they would have

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,010
gone ahead and just run through and fix

00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,270
it and they wouldn't have made the

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,610
mistake in the first place

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,380
but because I'm doing it afterwards I

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,360
have to go and clean up all the places

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,240
where it's like no you really you can't

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,429
do that that way the places where you

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,659
just like okay I made you some crap

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,610
JavaScript and threw it in there because

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,960
it kind of works and okay now

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,970
everything's fine but you actually

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,419
screwed up another part of the site that

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,919
you don't actually test it's also it's

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:51,080
just a way cheaper to think about it

00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,370
from the beginning so don't say this if

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,350
you say we'll fix it later you're gonna

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,940
regret trying to fix it later you should

00:28:54,350 --> 00:29:03,559
think about it from the beginning if it

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:07,090
only benefits disabled people there's a

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:09,530
saying a rising tide lifts all boats a

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,770
website that has been made accessible is

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:14,390
often better for everyone in order for a

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,700
screen reader to work perfect and in

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:20,000
order for a screen reader to work your

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,890
HTML has to validate I have never known

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,260
anyone that's like God our hTML is just

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:29,600
too good you know we've got to crap this

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:32,000
up a bit you know picking colors that

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,210
work for colorblind people force you to

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,690
think about your color choices how many

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,400
people who are not like designers just

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,650
throw some colors together and think

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,049
that works let's move on forcing

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,000
yourself to slow down and stop and think

00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:52,120
is always a good thing when it comes to

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,760
things like color choice having like

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,620
captions on videos first of all that

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,000
benefits anybody who like doesn't have

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,620
their headphones that day and is

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and wants to watch your you know Lowell

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:08,150
video but can't like play the audio it

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,679
also you know helps your SEO because now

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,270
you have that text there that you can

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,090
actually make searchable so people can

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:18,950
find that making elements large enough

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,020
to click on help not only people who

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,789
have motion disorders but anybody else

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,440
who does not want to spend like time

00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:28,039
trying to click the world's tiniest

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,320
checkbox or those little plus signs

00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:34,100
people put on things to expand things oh

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,270
I hate those I really do I'm so glad

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,980
they're like falling to the wayside

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,450
night and click the whole thing because

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:44,600
nobody liked those if you've done that

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:46,220
everybody hates you and my favorite

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,039
people with information processing

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,750
disabilities alike dislike things like

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:59,210
all caps busy backgrounds gratuitous

00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:02,240
motion poor contrast but who does like

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,919
those things like none of us are going I

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,799
wish these advertisements move to more

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,780
that'd be great oh I love it when it

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,780
rearranges the site in the middle of the

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,220
article that's nice we all hate these

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,679
things too the difference is we hate it

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,570
it makes it unusable for them however if

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,730
you make it accessible to them it's a

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,730
much nicer experience for the rest of us

00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:31,130
delusion I'll never need it I get it

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,730
you're healthy you're careful you don't

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,730
own an iguana

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,280
you don't think you'll ever have to deal

00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,110
with having a disability well there's a

00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,590
large group of people that are learning

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,810
that no they will have to deal with

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:51,850
having a disability

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:55,120
they're called baby boomers born between

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:59,190
the end of World War two in the mid 60s

00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,300
many many countries including Australia

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,540
experienced a sudden rise in their birth

00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,710
rate these babies called the Boomers are

00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:11,310
now in their late 40s to early 60s

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:14,560
they're discovering that aging sucks

00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:16,570
as you age no matter how healthy you are

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,360
you eventually fall into one of the

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,670
categories I laid out earlier your

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,860
vision starts to go your hearing starts

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,810
to go if you have a condition like

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,730
Parkinson's you may have a motion

00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,530
disorder suddenly you may have both

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,060
Rytas which limits how long you can use

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:36,670
your your laptop if you have something

00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,400
like dementia or Alzheimer's you will

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,230
start having cognitive impacts now the

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,570
sad truth about these two conditions is

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,850
it's not instant there's usually a good

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,730
decade of time where you are slowly

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,780
losing what capabilities you have but

00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,740
you're still trying to live

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,510
independently now making it so that you

00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,940
know they can live independently longer

00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,730
is better for everybody but if they

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,800
suddenly can't fill out forms you know

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,590
how do you survive how do you pay bills

00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:10,900
you know how do you get by in your day

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:13,630
to day life there's nothing special

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,760
about boomers though they're just

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,080
getting older and I'm sorry for any

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,440
boomers so I'm depressing in the

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,440
audience

00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,290
it's aging it's happening to all of us

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,650
for those in Generation X it's happening

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:32,260
already because I have many friends that

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,450
have several pairs of reading glasses

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,610
that are stashed around their person in

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,680
case they forget one so that's in there

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,180
you know laptop bag it's in their purse

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,980
it's in their jacket it's in their car

00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,920
because they're starting to realize that

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,090
they can't read without them yeah

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,490
they're starting starting to complain

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,210
about

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,260
restaurant lighting some of them have

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,710
actually started having things

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,990
discovering they have arthritis so

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,720
they're starting to age to Millennials

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:04,490
you're safe for now

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,920
but not for long even if the idea of

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,200
aging is far into the future for you you

00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,510
can still break an arm you can still you

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,389
know hurt your hand you might get sick

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,460
and need pain meds when I hurt my hand I

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,530
was on crazy amounts of like Bank

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,330
Euler's like the kind that we're just

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,210
below at the hospital needed to like

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,770
dispense and then though I K here's all

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,460
your happy drugs now here go fill out

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:32,119
these medical forms and I misspelled my

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,790
name multiple times my mother came I

00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:40,790
just like your middle name has one L not

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:43,010
two so and I was lucky I had a family

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,550
that swooped in and took care of

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:50,149
everything like I was a child again as

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,710
many people don't have that so it was

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:53,210
basically impossible I don't know what

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:57,230
would have happened to me had I not had

00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,850
family and during that time so if you

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:02,510
won't do it for the people that are

00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:05,960
disabled you know disabled today do it

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:09,470
for the person you will be in ten twenty

00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,630
or thirty years right now everything is

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,510
moving out of the analog world and into

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,600
the digital now then is the time for

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,190
accessibility to become a habit

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,300
now is the time when we build systems

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:25,730
that can be used by everyone now is also

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,680
the time to train the next generation so

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:31,600
that accessibility becomes a habit that

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,460
everyone has instead of a mesh

00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,030
discipline that a few people have that

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,400
are extremely overloaded right now now

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,440
is the time to build cultures where we

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,369
think about more than just the average

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,550
user and think about all the users thank

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:48,550
you

00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,990
thank you very much for that Katie so

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,660
we've got some time for questions we've

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:07,590
got some Q&A mics set up here so please

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,320
line up there alright first of all great

00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,610
thought thank you thank you um we have

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,360
actually worked on some government

00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:18,840
websites and we have to live up to the

00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,020
the W CAC 2.0 and you say there isn't a

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:27,240
checklist it is an actual checklist it's

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:28,980
a pretty terrible checklist but sorry I

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:34,020
have a lot of questions but I'll limit

00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,880
it to one um if you do graphs on a

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,070
website like you have lots of lots of

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,310
numbers and you display them in a pretty

00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:46,010
graph with docked points how do you show

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:48,950
that to a white person or with graphs

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:51,930
describe it to a friend over the phone

00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,730
so if you're trying like we often get

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,700
dime from the government to they love

00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:59,460
grabs trust me so many graphs at NASA

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,650
and what I would do is I would have a

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,070
graph that said you know I would say

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,650
okay you know we start off around this

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:11,280
level there is a peak at this level at

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,380
this time following off gradually to a

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,070
low at this time so pretend you're

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,710
narrating a you know radio show you use

00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,090
human language but you just describe

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,200
what the data points are I'm still

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,000
working with somebody who does

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,230
linguistics trying to make a more

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,990
naturalistic so you can do it

00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:31,350
automatically it's slow-going because

00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,390
linguistics is a difficult and it's hard

00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,460
to get his time it's sometimes a little

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,570
difficult but that's the advice I have

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,120
for most people is that when you're

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:42,420
generating those graphs try to describe

00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:45,630
it and as human away as possible or if

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,220
they're automatically generated figure

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,870
out a way that you can say okay in

00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,800
general what do these graphs look like

00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:54,120
and describe flow peak and rate and then

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,910
maybe give them an option that's like if

00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,430
you want to have more granular view go

00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,410
over here I cover that um it's it's a

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:03,360
tricky problem because you are trying to

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,760
convey information but you don't want to

00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,850
be too granular because that's not why

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,270
we use graphs because graphs are used to

00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,920
summer

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,290
information so you just kind of want the

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,830
summarization like a rising trend a

00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:21,060
falling trend a quickly falling trend no

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,870
trend flatline that kind of stuff have

00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,450
you seen any tool to do that

00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,370
automatically like what's we do have you

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:29,130
filter by something and you get a result

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,580
from that and we would display the

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,560
maximum the minimum the average yeah

00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:37,380
it's very hard to go yeah any further

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,700
than that not yet I'm it's slow working

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,650
on it cuz we're also two very busy

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,000
people that we've been going back and

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,080
forth it even just trying to figure out

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,820
the logistics and of course they're

00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,190
working with a linguist they're like

00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,360
super picky and they're like oh no

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,980
you've got to be more natural than that

00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,030
and I don't understand linguistics

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:57,600
always so but are you staying around for

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:59,460
the Sprint's well catch me during the

00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,850
day and we can talk about sure I'd love

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:06,150
that thank you I just II thanks again

00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,860
for the talk alright so sole

00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,780
accessibility is awesome I want to do

00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,140
all of it how do i level up other than

00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,750
buying your book or in addition to

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,340
buying your book how do I buy my book is

00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,320
a good starting point because it is less

00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,420
technical and more about the tools that

00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,100
people use you understand because that's

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,130
your first step is understanding the

00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,020
disabilities like deeply knowing the

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,480
tools they use knowing how to use a

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:33,270
screen reader knowing what it's like to

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,600
navigate via a keyboard you know what

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,570
are the tools they use then I do like

00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,250
pro html5 on accessibility because it is

00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,780
a technical book and it gives you lots

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,110
of just like oh you need to do this here

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,360
you go you'll be learning Aria Aria is

00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,690
really cool it is the fastest spec to

00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,680
make it into the HTML like spec ever

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:55,260
like they wrote it and a few months

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,020
later it was in but Aria basically gives

00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:03,920
roles to HTML elements so you can treat

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:06,480
things kind of you know as objects so

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,880
browsers know what to do when they hit

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,480
something that it's like oh this is an

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,890
application oh this is a dragon drop so

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,260
you can do drag-and-drop without a mouse

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,500
which is super cool I love playing with

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,500
those

00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:25,320
hang around accessibility psu.edu this

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,420
is the best accessibility site if you go

00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,980
around it would be like I recognize some

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,740
of these names these seem really

00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:36,320
familiar the reason why anybody know

00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:40,349
what clone is they've got a few hands

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,300
the people who were big players and

00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:44,369
plone when it first started this is

00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,930
where their funds this is the site they

00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:51,480
helped create plone is a 508 compliant

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,849
accessible it's an accessible CMS

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,460
written in Python which is one of their

00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:56,970
big selling points many of them are

00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,890
there

00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,270
so you'll see names that look really

00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,250
familiar

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,970
it's but it's a very it has a lot of

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:08,310
great examples that kind of stuff you

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:14,040
know of course you should you all should

00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:15,270
read the w3.org WK 20 or 2.0 because

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,720
that's what you're supposed to be

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,250
following and the last tube is check is

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,220
just a way to visually check what

00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,450
different color blindness like you can

00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,520
actually upload a screenshot of your

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,480
site or point it to a link and they'll

00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,109
say here's what it looks like with all

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,760
these different you know versions of

00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:35,640
colorblindness and it helps you pick

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,480
different you know color schemes so a

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,040
lot of is do some reading and just start

00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,300
really thinking about it every time you

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,650
go and do something where every time you

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,440
write some code or deal with some

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,750
front-end think about separate the

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,339
information in the presentation and make

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:54,650
sure the information the functionality

00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:57,390
can get to everyone last question please

00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,640
so you talked a little bit about Aria

00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,010
can you give an indication of sort of

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,270
how well deployed Aria is in actual

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,680
screen readers so I know that

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,030
historically there's been a problem that

00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,560
screen readers are crazy expensive and

00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,359
then you have to pay for the upgrade so

00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,770
a lot of users end up with a sort of

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,869
five year old 10 year old screen reader

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,730
because they can't afford to buy new

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:17,970
copies as they get updated

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:20,099
I don't know how recent jaws but I know

00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,760
drawers does have it I don't know how

00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:26,970
long ago however I do know that the

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,010
screen reader for max is fully compliant

00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,540
and that one's free if you want to turn

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:34,910
it on by the way

00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:37,590
it is function or it's like command f5

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,580
then that will turn it on and it'll

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,190
start your computer will immediately

00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,320
start speaking to you to see you're not

00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,860
don't do it when you don't want to make

00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:51,680
noise but it also has a tutorial as you

00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:54,720
go through but yes I know max caught up

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,850
let's see I think yeah NVDA is caught

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,970
ups that they have REO support our

00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:01,680
support at this point is pretty good

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,720
jaws it will always make me angry about

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,570
how expensive it is just because it's

00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,760
like guys are jerks but I that's why I

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:12,750
really you know like tell everybody

00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,660
about NVDA because NVDA is free and it's

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,010
Windows and it's really cool and I think

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,110
more people should use it instead of

00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,110
jaws my key

00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,020
thank you for coming all the way out

00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,339
here to get that can okay it's important

00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,339
and it was for farewell time

00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,640
