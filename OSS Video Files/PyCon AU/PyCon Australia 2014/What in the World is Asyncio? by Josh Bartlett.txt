Title: What in the World is Asyncio? by Josh Bartlett
Publication date: 2014-08-05
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	The Python 3.4 standard library contains a new module called "asyncio" (formerly "tulip"), which allows you to write single-threaded asynchronous code based on PEP 3156. This presentation will begin with an outline of what asyncio provides and how to use it, highlighting the kinds of use cases that it was designed for. The presentation will then go through a number of example use cases and within the context of these use cases, will compare asyncio with Twisted, one of the existing libraries for asynchronous programming. Finally, the presentation will touch on the question of interoperability between asyncio and libraries like Twisted, Pyramid and gevent.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
