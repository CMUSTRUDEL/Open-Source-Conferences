Title: What is OpenStack? by Michael Still
Publication date: 2014-08-07
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	OpenStack is one of the biggest python projects ever, and is hiring plenty of interesting python people to work on Open Source, which is cool. Yet, many people tell me that they don't really understand what OpenStack is. Let's fix that once and for all.

25 minutes isn't a long time, so what I'll provide is an overview of the various components of OpenStack and how they tie together. We'll cover what bits might be of interest to your average python hacker, as well as the general problems we're trying to solve. I secretly hope this will enthuse people to come and hack on OpenStack, but its also cool if audience members walk away from the talk deciding that OpenStack is not of interest to them -- so long as they now understand vaguely what OpenStack is, then we're cool.

I'll also try and cover how the OpenStack Foundation and code governance model works, but it might require talking really fast. We shall see!

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

what is OpenStack why Michaels still

00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:13,400
Michael is the project technical lead

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,260
for Nova one of the two original

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,359
OpenStack projects he's also a former

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,480
director of linux.com today you as well

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:27,720
as being a generally okay kind of guy

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,980
ladies and gentlemen Michael still thank

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,169
you let's just give people a second to

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,759
come in also because if I stall a little

00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,759
it won't look like the talks too short

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,650
Wow more people than I expected so

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,000
before we get started how many of you

00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,620
you people have used OpenStack before so

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,150
a couple all right cool because really I

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,130
want to talk to people who haven't so

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:56,250
into good that most of you haven't all

00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,370
right let's so let's get started so this

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,210
is a talk about what OpenStack is and

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,680
you know normally want to do one of

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,510
these talks I'd start off by saying Who

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,729
I am and why I'm kind of a big deal and

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,829
all that kind of stuff but the problem

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,930
with doing that is that then I'd have to

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,720
explain what all my job titles mean and

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,030
that's not the point of this talk I feel

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,610
like the OpenStack project is poured

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,380
explaining exactly what we do and the

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,729
problem we're trying to solve as I'm

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,960
going to just ask you to suspend

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,460
disbelief I'm just this guy named

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,740
Michael who happen to show up on time

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,360
and you're giving a talk so like I said

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,350
before this talk is about what open

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,630
snack is and i feel like the OpenStack

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,040
project explains itself poorly now

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,630
partially that's because it's a pretty

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,159
complicated project but it's also

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,380
because we get lost in the weeds really

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,520
quickly you know people come along and

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,440
we'll tell them about you know how many

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,479
developers we have what our code review

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,400
process looks like or you know we have

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,710
this cools continuous integration system

00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,900
that runs tests clouds and a large

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,060
number of them every day but really if

00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,650
you're a new user you don't care about

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,390
any of that stuff right you care about

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,119
the problem we're trying to solve and

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,180
whether or not we do that thing well or

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,549
badly so you know this talk is my

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,590
attempt to kind of reboot that

00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:12,180
conversation I guess it's kind of

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,340
prompted by the fact that I keep meeting

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
people at conferences who say I don't

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,880
really know what open snack is but I

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,410
don't like it and this

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,330
this really confuses me right like you

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,940
don't have to like my thing I'm okay

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,960
with that but I think if you're going to

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,670
not like something you should probably

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:35,260
know what it is first right so you know

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:38,260
try to bear with me so OpenStack is an

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,110
attempt to provide open source Python

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,400
components to build clouds so you know

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,050
obviously I'm trying to compress it into

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,790
seven words so it's more complicated

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,130
than that these are the important

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,770
concepts we believe in open source and

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,000
open governance it's all almost all

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,860
written in Python there's a little bit

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,440
of JavaScript and shell or whatever but

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,730
it's almost all in Python and these are

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,100
building blocks we don't necessarily

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,750
expect you to use all of them we do

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,080
expect them to plug together well and

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,459
that sort of thing but that totally

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,709
doesn't help either right because what's

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,080
a cloud so cloud means different things

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,580
to different people so you know people

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,980
talk about infrastructure as a service

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,450
which is you know I want our own virtual

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,680
machines and virtual networks and

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,470
there's some storage and plug it all

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,209
together for me there's platforms as a

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,650
service which is you know App Engine or

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,900
cloud foundry or whatever i want to

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,690
write my app on top of an API layer that

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,489
hides the complexity and then there's

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,320
software as a service I want you know am

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,750
I sequel database and I don't care where

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,799
it runs or how backups work I don't want

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,450
to admin on it I just want you to give

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,010
me a thing that I can use so the

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,049
majority of OpenStack is about

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,610
infrastructure as a service so it's

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,000
about delivering you compute resources

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,970
networks and storage in a way where you

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,200
don't really care where they came from

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,940
now you know it's about time when

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,500
someone has a slide with all the text

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,280
kind of pushed at the top because it's

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,530
obviously more complicated than that so

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,410
first off infrastructure as a service is

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,380
about providing infrastructure behind ap

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,600
is so we have an API that provides you

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,730
with compute resources virtual machines

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,769
containers physical machines that sort

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,290
of thing we have another API that

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,959
provides you with virtual networks so if

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,270
you boot say I don't know three virtual

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,370
machines you should be given a network

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,620
where your machines can talk but other

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,360
users can't see you and those virtual

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,070
networks can do things like firewalling

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,199
and load balancing and all that kind of

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,539
stuff as well

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,030
you probably also want storage there are

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,070
use cases for you know virtual machines

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,530
that have no storage at all but they're

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,660
rare so now that might be in the form of

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,820
virtual hard disks that last longer than

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,590
your virtual machine so maybe you know

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,970
you have a desk and you bring up a

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,380
virtual machine you do some stuff to the

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,990
disk and then the virtual machine goes

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,940
away but the disk hangs around and then

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,009
there's object storage so if I was

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,650
writing an app where I don't know I've

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,300
got an avatar for every user then object

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,550
storage is where I'd say we'll take this

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,259
picture shove it in this bucket and one

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,630
day later I'll ask for it back so it's

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,970
not you know it's not hard disk like

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,440
it's based around individual files and

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,720
you know getting and putting basically

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,360
in order to build those services we need

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,650
to have some other stuff right so we

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,099
need common libraries we've got

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,240
libraries that help us with logging or

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:27,099
config file parsing that sort of thing

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,930
and those libraries are written in a

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,789
reasonably generic manner we have like

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,740
an official style for what these things

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,060
look like but there's no reason that

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,699
other people couldn't pick up these

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,800
libraries and use them we needed

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,139
authentication now we could have plugged

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
into other authentication systems but if

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,690
you're building a large cloud you're

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,849
probably going to need something with

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,180
scoped tokens that scales and that sort

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:52,000
of thing so we have one of those we need

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,449
a virtual machine template system and

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,310
I'm trying to avoid the internal jargon

00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,870
for the project here so it's not really

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,220
a template you know if you're going to

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,169
build a virtual machine there's probably

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,229
some sort of starting disk image that

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,970
you have ubuntu 1404 or something and so

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,979
your home you go hey man leave me one of

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,409
these and then you end up with a virtual

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:14,490
machine that you can use and you

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:17,110
probably well users don't care i imagine

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,120
deployers of this software need metering

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,949
as well so they need to know how much of

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,620
a resource our user consumed so they can

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,449
build for it now we explicitly don't

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,680
solve the billing problem because

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,229
everybody's billing system is different

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,300
right some people use oracle financials

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,949
or you know if you're a smaller asp it

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,440
might be some hideous pearl thing that

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,240
you won't fess up to but you know so we

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,400
provide metering the user used this many

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,000
CPU seconds or this much RAM for this

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,960
period of time and then we let you

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,650
customize that's it plugs into your

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,699
horrible thing

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,280
we won't discuss and then there's you

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,199
know tools that users demand a web UI

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,820
there's also a command-line client and

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,490
they're just you know API clients

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,110
there's nothing magical about them and

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,020
people ask for service orchestration a

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,150
lot too so surface service orchestration

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,520
is where you have a config file and you

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,560
say let's pick on WordPress for a second

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,120
right you say I want a wordpress blog so

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,740
I've got a front-end and I've got a

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,300
database server and they have a private

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,729
network so they can talk but no one else

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,110
does and my blog about cats is going to

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,090
be super popular so we'll have a load

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,740
balancer so that when i have more front

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,750
ends it's all just like super sweet and

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,400
you express that in a config file and

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,789
then you throw that config file at us in

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,770
an api call and we just do it so if you

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,970
use amazon cloud formation it's much

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:36,760
like that there's also things that you

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,090
know big kids need so you know we have a

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,120
documentation project we have a QA team

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,280
and we have a series of tools to help

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,979
you deploy the software because this

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,660
software is intended to run on I think

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,460
the smallest working cluster I've ever

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,800
seen is five machines but we also have

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,360
people with 10,000 machines so there's a

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,740
bunch of tools around you know how do

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,870
you deploy the software how do you keep

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,240
it up 2day to that sort of thing so for

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,099
example there's arm in a puppet recipes

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,150
well I guess puppet don't pull in

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,490
recipes but you know there's puppet

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,050
modules and chef recipes there's also on

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,909
a project there's also a project that

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,800
builds further automation around that

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,889
but yeah there's just deployment tools

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,370
if you're a system admin I've

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,900
accidentally hit next there are things

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,669
the project needs to function because

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,070
it's hit a certain size we have an

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,020
internal infrastructure team that builds

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,340
our test systems and manages our website

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,810
and all that kind of stuff I don't

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,349
really know why this is Otto advancing

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,909
but anyway and you know there's a test

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,500
harness so developers can run up an

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,620
entire cloud on their laptop and make

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,080
sure that it actually works people also

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,080
keep asking for software as a service so

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,550
you know it's weird that you know you'd

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,529
bring up a virtual machine on a network

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,260
with an IP and not have a DNS entry for

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,029
example so we have one of those people

00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,360
like Hadoop so we have a system that

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,430
held

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,980
to deploy Hadoop jobs on top of the

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,000
cloud there's a queuing system because

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,220
if you were going to write an

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,019
application from scratch for cloud you'd

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,610
probably do it in a queue centric manner

00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,079
instead of you know traditional

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,360
client-server distributed system and

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,880
stuff and there's a key management

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,700
system which can be as simple as you

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,790
know my ssh keys to log into my various

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,110
virtual machines but we also intend we

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,480
haven't got there yet to use it for

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,860
things like cryptographically signing

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,930
API requests and stuff like that

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,170
especially for our internal interfaces

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,970
and to be honest I don't see at all how

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,170
this is confusing and I mean that

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,450
sarcastically so yeah there's a lot of

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,310
projects there's a lot of code it's a

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,050
complicated system and I think that's

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,910
one of our problems we get lost in the

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,649
weeds and we say you know oh well you

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,399
know if you want to run this thing you

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,350
need to install these 47 billion things

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,480
but fundamentally what we're trying to

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,040
do is provide bits you can use to build

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,690
a cloud if you want you don't have to

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,690
run our metering tools for instance I

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:10,600
don't know what is happening press pause

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,000
I think foolishly when I practice if I

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,769
said record the slide timings so it now

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,660
believes it should auto advance whenever

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,290
it thinks I'm ready which is not the

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,399
most helpful thing ever so just bear

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,420
with me I don't fiddle with my laptop

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:27,130
instead of talking OpenStack people also

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,240
become obsessed with numbers I think

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,390
because the numbers are big and that

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,089
makes us cool so we have 375 git

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,920
repositories when I counted yesterday

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,490
they're spread across 19 programs a

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,699
program being a thing that owns projects

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,990
and you know some of these git

00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,329
repositories are in track inside

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:54,440
programs but not all of them it's doing

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:56,720
it again stop add and you know like

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,130
there I've lost my place now and I think

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,140
we quote these numbers because we're

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,420
trying to explain why we're essentially

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,390
incoherent right so it's hard to explain

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,120
how a group of four thousand developers

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,830
believe anything consistently right it's

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,900
like this conference right presumably we

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,430
all believe in Python but some of us

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,890
will win those people and some of us are

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,540
running a freer operating systems or

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,710
whatever so we've got to kind of pick on

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,500
the high level stuff we all believe that

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,060
python is cool so you know open sank

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,460
people all believe that cloud is cool

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,140
but we don't necessarily all believe you

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,000
know the particular hypervisor is good

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,970
or you know a particular networking

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,920
technology or whatever so basically it's

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,140
4,000 people pulling in approximately

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,660
st. the same direction but the emphasis

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,890
really is on approximately you know when

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:45,200
you get into the nitty-gritty you will

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:48,740
find there is debate but sorry I really

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,720
wish this would have a would obey me we

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,630
also have a foundation it's much like

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,280
the Apache foundation so you know we

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,900
have a parent body that looks after

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,580
stuff like you know copyright ownership

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,920
of the code and running the design

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,200
summits and mailing lists and paying

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,630
people to make sure that you know our

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,370
back-end systems are still up original

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,750
it was all done by one of the founding

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,930
organizations for the projects

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,130
specifically Rackspace but that's not

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,740
perfect for an open source project right

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,570
you want something independent and it's

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,730
also like the Apache foundation in that

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,490
things don't always make consistent

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,490
sense right like it's strange to me that

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,990
a foundation associated with web servers

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,370
Apache has a cloud snack but

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,220
fundamentally the user said hey man we

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,480
need to solve this problem as well so

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,880
we're a bit like that too if someone

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,560
comes to us and says well I really want

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,600
to solve this thing and I'll only open

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,330
source it if it can be associated with

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,550
OpenStack what's better to say no and

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,780
not have the thing at all or say okay

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,680
well we'll be a little bit weird and

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,950
very Guerrero our mission and there's

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,800
also the OpenStack bump it's my little

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,120
fist pump thingy are downloaded which is

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,860
that at the moment for better or for

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,320
worse there's a marketing bump

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,150
associated with being involved with the

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,530
OpenStack project so we have a lot of

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,590
people come to us and say I want to do

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,330
this thing because

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,770
want the OpenStack logo want to because

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,410
then you know money will fall from the

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,520
sky and again if that's the only way

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,640
we're going to get them to do the thing

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,470
then maybe that's good it's you know so

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,760
sometimes hard to tell to be completely

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,800
honest I really wanted to put an MC

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,290
Hammer joke here you know stop sign with

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,250
hammer time spray-painted under it and I

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,750
thought that would be unique and

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,160
hilarious and never done before until I

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
looked at google image search and it

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,730
turns out every man and his dog has one

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,630
of these pictures so now making a meta

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,980
joke about not making the joke instead I

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,290
think I've lost my way again basically

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,580
like when I this is not contrived when I

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,470
wrote these slides actually wrote them

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,000
in this order and I was like well I've

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,440
become what I'm complaining about right

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,730
I'm telling you about numbers and we

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,590
have a foundation with a lot of money

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,630
and it's got a board and you know wow we

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,920
have trademarks no one cares right what

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,030
you care about is the problem we're

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,340
trying to solve so someone much smarter

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,930
than me at work put it this way in an

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,080
email that I've quoted with our

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,610
permission which is really we should be

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,380
trying to explain what problem we're

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,790
trying to solve and specifically it's

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,330
something like a Python event why a

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,470
Python programmer would care so I think

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,270
I've done the first bit a little bit

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,490
right we're trying to give you building

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,110
blocks to build a cloud that can be a

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,740
small cloud or it can be a big cloud but

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:28,410
hey cloud but I haven't really explained

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,630
why a Python person should care so first

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,480
off we're writing a huge amount of open

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,250
source Python so you know there's a lot

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,350
of code out there that people can use if

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,180
they want to we're also doing it all as

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,740
open source so you know we have these

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,210
libraries that might be reusable or

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,870
useful to you and are probably worth

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:48,000
having a look at we're also hiring a lot

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,460
of interesting Python people and I think

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,840
this is part of the problem is that you

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,990
know occasionally we hire someone's

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,150
friends but not them or something and

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,100
that can be like awkward man but

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,020
ultimately you know we're hiring

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,520
interesting Python people who might have

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,020
been trapped in a proprietary

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,760
organization doing something you've

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,220
never seen and we're saying hey man do

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,740
that in public and that's cool because

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,690
they're again writing code that you can

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,350
see and you can learn from and you can

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,610
use interestingly we're also starting to

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,080
get to the science we're starting to

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,970
talk about manipulating the world around

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,819
us to meet our emotional needs

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,589
so we're starting to hire core Python

00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,660
developers and saying you know we have

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,689
this problem maybe its performance or

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,129
something instead of you know changing

00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,899
language or whatever maybe we can just

00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:36,420
fix the language and that benefits

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,920
everyone so that's really cool we're

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,810
also starting to talk about you know

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,060
hiring called Jango developers because

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,439
our web user interfaces in Django so

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,449
maybe we'll end up accidentally

00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:47,490
improving things for everyone even if

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,319
you don't care about open snack so I

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,949
think that's a really interesting you

00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,360
know direction for us to be taking but

00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,490
ultimately I think you should care

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,250
because having an open source cloud

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,949
implementation really really matters

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,470
even if you use Amazon and I'm happy for

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:07,560
you to use Amazon having competitors

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,149
keeps everyone honest so you know sure

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,589
there's amazon in there's Google but

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,769
there's also a bunch of public clouds

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:17,790
running OpenStack Rackspace HP dreamhost

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:21,149
aptera there's a bunch of them anchor is

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,709
relatively new in Australia having

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,300
alternatives it means you're not trapped

00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:27,000
when you decide you need to move on and

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,709
that's really important the other thing

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,449
is it's cool that you can take the same

00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:33,000
software and run it in your own data

00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,439
center so let's say you have data you

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,639
don't want to ship off to an American

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,040
company or you don't want to have

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,350
outside your data center you can run the

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,319
same software that those people do and

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,000
have the same facilities but in your own

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,860
universe so maybe if you're doing health

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,389
data or or you know you have data

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,040
sovereignty concerns or whatever that

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,529
might be a thing that you care about and

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,300
that's important because you know we're

00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:57,029
training a generation of programmers to

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,949
write apps in this cloudy way and if you

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,870
can't run them in-house then you'd be

00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:05,069
forced to go and pay amazon or someone

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:09,059
like that to run your apps so anyway the

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,730
basic point here is I think this matters

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,939
because open source cloud is important

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,309
to providing facilities to people and so

00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,299
I hopefully I've explained what

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,949
OpenStack is just a little um we have a

00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,039
few minutes for questions if people are

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,039
interested

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,340
