Title: The Curse of the Django Podcast by Elena Williams
Publication date: 2014-08-07
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	The Django community is full of amazing, enthusiastic and multi-talented individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects in their massive amounts of spare time. 

A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.

I am the latest to take up this torch.

This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best, brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work but also a load of fun.

Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you can be part of the greater Django information and communication machinery.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

	00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,959
yep good afternoon everybody we've got a

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,279
later on this afternoon I don't know

00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,559
very much about it but she's going to

00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:22,490
tell you exactly what she's up to so

00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:24,140
over to you Elena thank you yeah well

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,600
and what I'm talking about is um a

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,699
django podcasting so i started doing a

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,780
django podcast about six months ago but

00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,170
really this is a talk about

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,910
disseminating news to the community so

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,129
what i will say is that this is a talk

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,630
about a listening medium forms of form

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,899
of communication the specific about

00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:45,500
podcasting and the my process in doing

00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,720
this podcast so far and that there are

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,079
lots of other ways of communicating such

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,610
as blogs and through documentation and

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,500
this is just one way so firstly i will

00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,239
say that i have no special authority to

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,309
be doing this I've been blessed by

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,100
anybody or put forward I don't have any

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,990
special audio engineering training

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,460
unfortunately I just this is an idea

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,350
I've had and it's something i sat down

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,240
and started doing and this is my process

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,770
to getting there and the other thing is

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,409
that this is something I do very much

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,900
for me I don't really I don't know if

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,280
any of you have heard my podcast I don't

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,350
really make it for other people but it

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,430
just seems such a shame to do all that

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,710
work and not publish it publicly so this

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,170
is a frame of mind I'm coming from which

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,479
is kind of a weird way to make a podcast

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,159
but nonetheless for those of you who

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
have read the abstract you all know that

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,420
I'm not the first person who was in part

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,939
on the good ship Django podcast there

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,920
has actually been a podcast around for

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,590
pretty much all of Jango's public

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,390
history I went and contacted although

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,299
I'm the fifth person this is the fifth

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,790
iteration of a Genco podcast I went and

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,869
I talked asked all those guys what the

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,400
process was that they went through and

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,170
they kindly got back to me so this is a

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,640
brief history of the Django podcast so

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,710
far so the very first one was called

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,259
this week in Django and was with Michael

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,209
tree and he has a music degree in his

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,679
background but I'm Barrowman none of

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,390
these guys have any formal audio

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,639
engineering training here it was the

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,480
closest by virtue of having um done a

00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,840
music degree and he ran for two years

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,620
and

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,480
more than 50 episodes and his podcast

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,209
inspired me the very most he had a very

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,500
technical format he got criticism for

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,269
the technical format but most people

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,940
really liked his but what happened is

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:35,480
that he had a family and then just ran

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,260
out of energy and so it was taken over

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,720
by Brian rosner and Eric Florentino who

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,080
Brian used to work on with Michael on on

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,640
this week in Django and they had a lot

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,290
of other contributor to you like Alex

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,069
Gaynor was involved with this project as

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,870
was a great tournament Greg Newton did

00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,260
all of their graphics and they had a

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,400
pretty good run they only took the

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,049
technical parts are they took one

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,370
technical part of the previous podcast

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,319
and there had they had a more

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,940
conversational tone with tracking trunk

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,470
and then there was a bit of report a gap

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,360
and I think what kind of happened was

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,090
that junk I just stabilized there wasn't

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,670
really a lot of a lot of things going on

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,230
so micro tree has started at the time

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,290
with magic removal it just happened and

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,549
there was not a lot of resources out

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,410
there there was just a bunch of blogs

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,720
really and so he would kind of gather

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,889
that all up and publish it so by the

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,510
time these guys worked around it's all

00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:30,799
pretty stable so these guys were done

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,150
talk about different they would just

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,440
pick a different topic and although i

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,450
would have an interview subject and then

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,549
have chats about it and then they were

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,230
followed by these guys who were had

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,900
their podcast sponsored by lincoln loop

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,639
and so that's Kenneth love and Brandon

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,950
conquer and they had a really fun

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,959
podcast actually it went for like it was

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,419
quite long it went for an hour or so and

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,540
they would have an interviewee and they

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,639
would prepare a bunch of bits of content

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,410
that had happened in the recent history

00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,120
and they would talk about so they had

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,680
all kinds of interviewees come in and

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
talk about these things with them so

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,880
they had like Jacob Kaplan marcin kanth

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,660
rights as well as new developers as well

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,500
who were only who weren't as

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,269
high-profile in the community so that

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,340
was really fun but it came to a very

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,190
abrupt halt at the end of last year

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,720
basically because um Kenneth left

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,530
Lincoln loop to go and work on a

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,240
different project so this is where the

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,300
curse came in so if you can't read that

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,130
that is posting the curse of the Django

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,400
podcast oh my gosh what's happened

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,800
another one has died

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,590
and so this is from six months ago and

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,910
this is kind of where this podcasting

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:42,570
ordeal epic starts for me or really

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,669
seriously so thinking back to the going

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,039
back to the this week in Django format I

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,690
started when I that was around I when I

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,750
was starting to learn to use Django and

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,870
you learn to use Python trough ericsson

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,770
in 2008 I started listening to this and

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,830
was always a fan and even though I

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,500
didn't understand a lot of things he was

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,990
saying in the more technical parts of

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,580
the podcast just by hearing him talking

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,660
about it and using the language and

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,160
pronouncing the terms correctly and

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,850
giving it talking about in context

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,560
really had a big impact on me and I we

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,870
always really liked the tweed format was

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,160
really sad when it was over and the

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,650
other thing I learned from it took away

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,270
from this time is the week bit I kind of

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,099
way even back then I vividly recall

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,139
thinking that if I ever had a podcast I

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:35,190
would never publish it weekly because it

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,320
just seemed like so much work there so

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,470
he's a format was he had all of these

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,910
different sections like I saying that

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,949
there were blog put random blog post

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,020
around about how you went and learn and

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,539
did things at the time but no

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,340
centralized place where you could find

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,360
out what you needed to do everyone was

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,340
kind of more or less working off the

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
trunk so he would go through and talk

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,710
about everything major that hit trunk at

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:04,020
that time really really useful but for

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,750
me after yeah the story my story starts

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,729
with them with that guy and what had

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,729
happened was I joined us as user group

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:15,150
because I moved into the locality last

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,099
year and I found going to the user group

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,080
I would ask gross about them like you

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,940
know contrast based views like he's

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,470
talked yesterday and just like an

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,960
informal version of his talk yesterday

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,789
him talking for five or ten minutes

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,699
about his experience of this you know

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,780
like putting it in two contexts that you

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,760
know we had this going on at the time

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,520
and someone's how had done this and this

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,740
was going on and this is how we made it

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,029
work and I learn more from that 5-10

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,889
minutes then I went learned from evening

00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,840
after evening of documentary

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,389
documentation and reading source code

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,099
and what I really wanted was like the

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,749
first time I had this conversation and

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,550
had this intention oh my gosh I've just

00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:52,800
learnt so much about how the core

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,900
internals of Django work that I wanted

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,909
like some microphone just to drop from

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,249
the sky to record it and put it out for

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:02,159
everybody to hear and you know like some

00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:07,650
like not me do it but like some kind of

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:09,719
abstracts like microphone coming from

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,210
drop from the ceiling and you just to

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:14,099
get the version of you of what of what

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,620
people were thinking when they made

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,229
suckers it's normally a rip write a

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,909
story like you read you know uploading

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,259
or migrations or something and it's

00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:25,110
really really dry and boring whereas

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:29,430
it's this massively rocky exciting trip

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,289
to get to that point so based upon this

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,120
i sat down in the middle of November

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,979
last year so this time round up is still

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,240
going and that's really tops podcast and

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,029
you know you just have tons of project

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,610
ideas and I scribble down my idea for my

00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,900
dream format podcast like again I was

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,639
not going to do this because I obviously

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,370
I don't have audio engineering skills

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,689
and but this is the podcast I want to

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,819
hear taken a lot from this week and

00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,849
Django and with that idea in mind and

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,460
also I really like the idea of having

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,430
something like this around to make me do

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,860
my home like was part of the format was

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,889
to go through and do people's homework

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,479
on their behalf so rather than like this

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,219
is what I wanted out of a podcast was

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,990
that something just saved me from having

00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,219
to read through everything that it just

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,569
happened like I can just pop it in my

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,509
headphones for like half an hour and

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,469
just know and be up to speed and I have

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,129
a long tradition of doing other people's

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:21,839
homework for them to my own detriment um

00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:24,270
relatedly I've also spent a lot of time

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,250
on the inside of universities and so I'm

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,539
also of the academic frame of mind where

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,189
we have all the time in the world to do

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,779
whatever we want but since I've been

00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,159
involved Django I'd been involved with a

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,349
couple of publishing projects like a

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,779
magazine and other content that came out

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,969
weekly and these people are crazy like

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,979
they have this deadline and they pump

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,870
things out on a weekly basis and I can't

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,430
do that because I'm from this lala land

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,940
of academia we have all the time in the

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,529
world but I wanted that I why still want

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,819
that and I've been scanning around for

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,570
projects where I could do that where I

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,280
would have an excuse to pump something

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,390
at all at the same time so all of this

00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,370
happened very quickly look round up was

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,260
cancelled and then suddenly it was a

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,880
right near Christmas and at the same

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,300
time the Michael tread Nick award was

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,860
handed out and Curtis was going to do

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,970
the update mi he was one of the people I

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,710
talked to about the idea of doing a

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:18,490
podcast but because I was the only one

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,290
in here this fantastic radio voice so it

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,090
comes in it but he's he's not a person

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,370
who likes to audio medium either not

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,560
like me being a crazy listening to

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,450
podcast person the other thing that

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,190
happened was that it was Christmas so I

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,900
suddenly had a few days afraid I was

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,760
going to say with them with Curtis was

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,470
it he started on the twenty-ninth doing

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,420
that pod the updates em on the

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,340
twenty-ninth of december i would start

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,200
doing the podcast on the same date and

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,220
that way we'd kind of you know each

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,480
other on to continue both on the other

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,970
thing was Christmas out a few days freed

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,040
up and also my park on us coffee been

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,350
accepted and I really needed to improve

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,080
my speaking style because I'm prone to

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,670
speaking really badly and nothing is

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,740
will do that for you better than having

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,390
to listen to her own voice a lot but I

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,490
was also very reserved about the

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,130
decision because I knew about this curse

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,270
and I wanted to have a podcast that

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,950
would go on forever so I was gonna

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,230
commit to it I was going to commit to it

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,260
long term so I went it was wild eyes

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,490
I've and um like the other thing is that

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,660
um you're also unlike normal people

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,130
don't really like the sound of my own

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,590
voice like st. curse has a great voice

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,210
me on the other hand but one of my other

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,530
fro so I will say that the reason we

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,690
don't let the sound of your own voice is

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,330
um that you hear your voice through the

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,650
bones in your jaw not through airwaves

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,030
so when you hear it recorded you're

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,190
actually hearing a different voice to

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,330
the voice that you hear in your head so

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,920
and that's a really awkward thing to do

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,600
I knew this I still don't like the sound

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,250
of my own voice I close my eyes and I

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,360
made the decision I'm going to get over

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,430
that and i'm just going to pump

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,080
something out one of my other friends

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,060
gave me a really excellent complement in

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,230
that he an English friend of mine

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,820
actually said that all of the other

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,160
podcasts were from Americans and a lot

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,780
of Americans tend to do them and it's

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
kind of nice to have an Australian

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,500
accent reading out news because you know

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,830
this reaction it's not that offensive

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,579
and you know that it's pretty passive

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,049
you know already an American

00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:08,029
it's a particularly the American radio

00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:12,850
voice tends to be it can be a little bit

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:15,559
harsh to our old empirical ear so my

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,600
another reason I don't do it or that

00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,759
would make this easier for greater

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,499
longevity is because I'm not creating

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,689
any content I'm just collecting it and

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,879
spitting it back out if it will contact

00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,470
collection content creation it would be

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:31,579
a different thing it would be a lot more

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,869
effort and so and I first took show this

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,670
your us he's like okay so what you're

00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:36,259
doing is you're like getting the blog

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,499
and you're reading it out loud and I'm

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,360
like what um actually yeah but you know

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,489
what there's actually nothing wrong with

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,379
that there happens to be this format

00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:47,179
that exists that does exactly that and

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,910
the other thing that was that I wanted

00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:51,559
it to be really kind of dry like

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,069
homework style and not to editorialize

00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,329
too much even now and I editorialize

00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,829
when i'm recording and i just can't help

00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,089
myself i'm like yeah and i think that

00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:00,709
that's a really good thing and isn't

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,629
that awesome but I edit all that out

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,670
because it's just not important but I

00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,860
have found that all the radio show that

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,779
I love the very most I have are driven

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,480
by the personality that delivers them

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,579
and so this is a balance to me like I

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,679
don't really know where how to deal with

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,989
that but you know news anchors get

00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,879
switched out so are you bound to their

00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:22,360
personality I don't know and the other

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,739
thing is true that this is a point where

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,439
because it's got that kind of music

00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,970
format it can for longevity trade out

00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,410
people so right now if somebody just

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,779
wanted to do a section of my podcast

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,089
record it and edit it and give it to me

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:37,429
I would chuck it in without asking any

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,499
questions because it's just about

00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,389
getting the work done and I will mention

00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:43,730
too that the fun bit is the recording

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,350
and the editing is really laborious I do

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,399
get lots of big girl hope your record

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,689
some and I'm like that's not the

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,819
recording part that's hard if the

00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:52,459
editing part that's a pain and I'm

00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:54,709
another issue for me is about being

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:57,980
having fame and attention because I'm

00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,749
not unlike a introvert like I'm a nerd I

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,369
really i like having friends but I don't

00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,319
really like being in this some people

00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:04,939
like this I'm not and so this kind of

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,339
makes it kind of challenging for me to

00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:09,619
like I saying I like it being out there

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,999
but I kind of am still not this is

00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,309
something that I personally have to come

00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,959
to terms because when people tell me

00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,369
that they listen to my podcast i freak

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,760
out and all I can think of is mistake

00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,320
sizing

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,720
and all the sketchiness of my learning

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,810
process with the editing audio editing

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,280
so that's some you know there are things

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,380
at willing let's saying it I do it for

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,490
me not for other people like from my own

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,020
embedment as a person so just for

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,990
learning it for recording for radio is

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,700
that I've picked up on my jawed is that

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,930
when you're recording for radio what you

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,120
need to do is you need to always be

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,680
talking as if your dress addressing one

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,960
single person so I look like this I

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,690
don't record my podcast like this I you

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,640
had need to do it so you you'll find

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,200
that all radio people do that they are

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,850
actually talking as if they're talking

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,890
to one person and you can also talk

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,660
extremely slowly so if you listen to the

00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,800
word count of people on radio find out

00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,870
it's really really slow and you're

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,930
moreover you're less inclined to UM and

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,040
are when you're speaking slowly or so

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,330
when you're doing talking to other

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,280
people you got to be really careful not

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,600
to talk on top of each other and you

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,890
also have to be really careful not to

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,660
match your words together this is a

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,310
problem I have I tend to run my

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,820
sentences together and my word so it

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,530
makes it much harder for editing this is

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,040
the array and this is the stuff that we

00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,530
really love of condenser mics that all

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,500
of the different podcasters used in the

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,030
sordid history of Django and I had an

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,460
agonizing process so the first one I

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,320
ever did my personal podcasting

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,330
experience so far has been like a trail

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,620
of really sketchy microphones because it

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,390
was Christmas I got my parents to buy me

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,310
like this kind of pretty crappy headset

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,380
and I recorded on that initially and I

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,340
spent months making a decision and I

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:48,500
ended up picking this one and I was

00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,180
really thrilled plea to hear later when

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,160
i called my ass my could ask them or

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,930
what equipment is michael tria happens

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,880
to use exactly the same one of this just

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,070
by coincidence and his is the format i

00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,650
like the very best it's a cardioid

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,830
condenser microphone it's surprisingly

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:07,220
heavy it and what that means is it just

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,320
or it records in a bubble around my

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,520
cardioid being heart-shaped and the

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,380
other thing too was always told that

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,270
with these microphones the higher

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,860
quality nets America finds if you record

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,690
them in a figure-of-eight they're really

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,860
good at buffering sound perpendicular to

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,810
them so if you have a problematic

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,520
background noise you can just simply

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,410
take like a fridge that won't stop

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,180
making noise or a noisy window you

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,820
simply turn your microphone in a figure

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,110
eight in figure 8 sideways to that and

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,089
you'll

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,260
inclined have background noise I still

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,459
have a problem with dodgy background

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,420
noise this is something i think i were

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:40,180
to figure out and to have a padded room

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,800
of sort because I've done it very much

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,120
on the fly and traveling I still have a

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,820
problem with this too but recording in a

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,000
car is really good surprisingly as a

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:52,690
sound booth and a main part of my

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,579
podcast is recording introduced with all

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,230
these guys and it's been really easy for

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,350
me with a django podcast because

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,240
something is usually topical so the

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,269
first interview i did with with Emmerich

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,640
and with andrew and at that time apple

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:08,620
the a pre-loading refactor was happening

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,709
so it was really obvious to talk to him

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,480
and what i did was i simply asked them

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,250
and I was really nervous because these

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,290
people like crazy high profile and their

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,720
time is so precious and I just sent them

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,490
anywhere going hey do you mind if I I

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,019
asked if you talk to me about what your

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,209
process was like it's okay to talk to

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:29,800
rascal I know Russ but like I'm only to

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:31,570
Andrew like he's terrified um and they

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,070
were great but you know I've really

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,019
really careful i really wanted to be

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,500
really accommodating and considerate of

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,000
their time and i would send a list of

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,170
questions in advance we'd negotiate the

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,209
questions out and there by the time we

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,220
talked like all these guys did a lot of

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:48,010
homework for their talks about likes in

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,870
a list and i swear that they had written

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,279
answers that they responded with and so

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,839
when we were recording it like it was

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,339
just traitor i ask them the questions

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,010
like in a talking way and they read it

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,810
back and when you listen to it it really

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,699
doesn't sound like that so I'm like I

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,140
reckon that that happens in the outside

00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,530
world more than you think that it's all

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,480
scripted and you don't even know if so

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,220
what the way that we usually did record

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,020
was over Skype I hangouts is de rigueur

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,939
these days so in the ideal interview

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,799
situation if you're interviewing long

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,240
distance with somebody you get them to

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,220
record it at their end with some

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,959
recording technology usually audacity

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,540
because it's cheap and free it's free

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,429
and easy to use i should say i recorded

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,250
at my end and then we have i have a

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:29,770
skype recorder and hangouts harder to

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,929
get recorded for Scott Scott quality is

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,669
poorer whereas hangouts quality is

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,520
higher but recording on hats is much

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:39,630
harder also I'm in the dumbest time zone

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,300
in the world i'm on west australian time

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,120
so we always always negotiating time

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,300
zones in a thing but I still make a

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,100
crazy hash of reporting long distances

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,620
so the I did an interview last week with

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,120
ola and all up for about django girls

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,490
and i made a complete hash but it's

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,590
almost unlistenable bad but it's kind of

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,660
so nice to talk to them that I'm going

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,180
to publish it anyway probably tonight

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,930
like it's all done I just have to master

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,640
the guts to push it up to i use for i

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,470
use audacity like I just said I reckon

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,660
it's a great example of an open source

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,160
project and these are all of the

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,990
different technologies that all of the

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,050
other guys are prone to using i hope to

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,690
level up to these as my experience

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:24,240
increases this is something this is

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,460
basically the audio editing procedure is

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,440
doing that and it takes about you know

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,790
it's a ratio that one to ten so for

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,200
every minute that's what one of my

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,660
finger podcast looks like why different

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,100
sections or my music stings so Adrian

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,990
holla party to music sting for the

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,520
original podcast which he generously

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,710
gave me permission to use which you

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,130
don't compose I loved it then but we'd

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,250
use it and i love it now i publish it on

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,720
soundcloud they basically the others had

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,070
all dumped it down to editorial org and

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
just put it up I love soundcloud it's

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,430
like I didn't go back to that back

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,250
further than that because um I missed a

00:18:53,430 --> 00:19:01,170
couple because I got too busy and I was

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,850
a junior at PyCon so sorry um I do

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,470
whatever it takes to get it out I beg

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,680
bribe and control myself chocolates and

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:11,730
wine if I finish it so the correct begs

00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:14,130
the question will i make it i I want it

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,710
to be just a thing that I do and I want

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,420
to involve more people and I think that

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,270
that's probably the Magic Bullet of

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:25,110
making at last and you know what like

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,160
just last a couple of weeks ago I was

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,980
looking around to listen to a podcast

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,270
kyla listen to podcast and I feel that's

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,610
what I was looking for was exactly the

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,050
podcast I make so I was like okay well

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,360
that's reassuring as I saying a bit

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,820
technical not too fluffy but not too

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,890
long not okay well that's reassuring um

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,510
the other thing is i'm still like it's

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,430
only six month in six months and I still

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,140
find it crazy fun and compelling so I'll

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,450
release it I'll go through the big high

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,730
and the wretched below

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,350
and you know a week will pass and I'll

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,820
start getting itchy to do it again like

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,860
a week or two I'll start gathering news

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,090
and I want to contact other people and

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,150
there are big pile of interviews that

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,430
I'd love to do still and I just have to

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,470
spend the time to be able to let other

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,790
people into this process which I'm you

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:10,020
know looking forward to it i mean this

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:13,860
talk is part of that process uh-huh but

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,750
really only involving other people in

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,300
the process I do think that this is a

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,340
landscape where lots of communication

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,920
needs to happen I really believe what my

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,960
podcast really dry it's about news that

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,790
Django roundup could still be going or

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,460
something very much like it and when I

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,560
asked those guys for feedback as to what

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,760
advice they would give me and if they

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,920
were to do it again what they would do

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,630
differently they said that one thing

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,610
they did say was that they would you

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,380
know branch out into other things as

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,220
well like not necessarily Django maybe

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,770
other Python web development things and

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,320
you know other medium like if this is

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,360
the learning through audio I happens to

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,290
work for me I like listening to lectures

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,820
but different people learn in all kinds

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,170
of different ways one of the biggest

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,630
feed bits of feedback I get is that is

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,340
there a transcript because I don't want

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,870
to listen to the whole thing I just want

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,940
those snippets of information and the

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,790
other thing is too is it is about

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,460
getting information out so we like best

00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,840
that that we understand best and

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,330
everyone understand things in a

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,500
completely different way and Django is

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:28,020
notoriously bad at having it come having

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,990
its news distribution very fragmented

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,370
and communication distribution and just

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:38,730
last week this was the idea was proposed

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,470
of breaking the core up so that problem

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,900
of their kind of any sort of inner

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,820
circle existing can be broken down the

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,830
people in the inner circle don't like it

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,380
the people outside that don't like it

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,420
and you know it's really what's his

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,880
space this is literally last week

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,970
they're talking about making different

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,520
elements different elements of the core

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,460
team not just one sort of module

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,880
cool that just does everything and

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,500
everyone gets burnt out we do need all

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,690
these different things done in all

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,510
different ways by all different people

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,460
so really that's what it's about it's

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,660
about being involved in the communities

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,880
are more involved you are the more

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,470
likely you are to hang around and we all

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,900
get nice things so um these are the guys

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,580
who definitely deserve their name on a

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,600
slide who have done the podcast before

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,430
and and these are all my interviewees

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,070
that I've had even just in this short

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,750
time and I'm so great every single

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,730
person I've asked his it's gone yeah

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,080
sure and the one thing that really

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,610
struck me in the beginning because I

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,340
would still like to super star struck by

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,220
these guys was just how humble layer and

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,860
how like generous and friendly and you

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,690
know I go you know I'm kind of like I'm

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,730
I always introduce it like oh you know

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,890
I'm kind of really new to this and I'm

month-to-month basis and then listing my

00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:58,739
plans for who I hope to be featuring

interviewing for that particular release

00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:06,190
for anyone who's been watching obviously

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,809
my django update posts have kind of died

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,580
recently you know sort of lost momentum

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:11,889
on them however i was thinking from what

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,450
you were saying in the talk perhaps we

00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:15,279
should really synchronize the release of

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,289
your podcasts with the release of the

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,130
Jaguar updates and share all the content

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,350
with them

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,660
I was about to say are you happy with

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:27,790
that but I can already speak five you

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:30,580
