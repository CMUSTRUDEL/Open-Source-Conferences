Publication date: 2014-08-11
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2014
Description: 
	Web APIs are how much of the modern web speaks - services speaking HTTP and JSON are ubiquitous, and nearly everything from your phone to your TV interacts with one of them. We'll go over how APIs are structured and versioned, why you should validate your data, and why you should have them in the first place -- and what other best practices are when creating them.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.
