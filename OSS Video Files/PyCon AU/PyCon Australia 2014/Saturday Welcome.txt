	00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,809
so welcome to everyone 380 people there

00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:16,029
abouts there's a few more tickets than

00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:26,200
that we're pretty happy with those

00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:28,829
numbers a very important part of our

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,849
community is our code of conducts

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,680
looking after everyone there looking out

00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,239
for it each and every one the code of

00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,040
conduct is available up on the website

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,300
so if you're not familiar with it please

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,550
go and read it it's very hard to

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,100
condense code of conduct into a simple

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,000
thing be nice to people please

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,579
respective ryans boundaries disagree

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,720
with ideas disagree with people but you

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,160
can still be pleasant about it so the

00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,100
registration desk which I hope you've

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,610

front here this is Russell this is me

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,570
we're both wearing matching we're both

00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:11,609
wearing matching kilt so it should be

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:14,109
easy to find we have some

00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:17,439
representatives from our parent group

00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:21,310
Linux Australia here Joshua hesketh the

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,639
president Christopher no avail Richard

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,959
Jones and Tim Ansel so those are also

00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:31,149
people that you can approach if you've

00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:34,749
got any issues mini Council yesterday so

00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:38,979
get in your time machine we would really

00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:40,569
like to thank Russell Grahame ed Joshua

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,119
and Robert for all the work they did

00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,869
organize them as many counts

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,340
particularly for putting up with a

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:47,340
certain very grumpy conference organizer

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:02,200
if you registered on time you will have

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,530
gotten a t-shirt at registration time if

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,740
your t-shirt does not fit you may

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,790
exchange it for a different size during

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,600
morning tea on Sunday if you would like

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,950
t-shirt and you didn't register in time

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,260
leftovers will be available from Sunday

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,760
afternoon lightning talks we have two

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,459
sessions of lightning talks of half an

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,410
hour each on Saturday and Sunday sign up

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:34,180
outside on one of the whiteboards each

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,390
talk is five minutes so a lightning talk

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,130
is a very quick talk five minutes and we

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,900
will basically pull the plug on you once

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,800
you reach five minutes on any topic

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,580
that's of interest to you provided it's

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:55,000
not a advertising particular product or

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:58,510
company and it's not recruiting so today

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,100
in b3 we have two tutorials once those

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,470
tutorials are finished and for the rest

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,080
of the conference these room will be an

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,400
open space so you can consider the

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:13,299
sprints as essentially starting in b3

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,730
after the tutorials are finished we do

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,860
have some printed schedules at the

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,940
registration desk they'll meant to be in

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,940
the Leonard's but we didn't get that far

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,860
we've got the jobs board we've got the

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,470
two white boards at the front so if you

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,450
are looking for work or you've got jobs

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,010
that you'd like to fill flight details

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,420
at the front we've got we've got it

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,239
we've got a fair bit of space but don't

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,769
don't um don't use up all the space

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:50,200
because we will just make you use up

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:54,790
less space like none um Wi-Fi so we have

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:58,380
our Wi-Fi network the SSID is parkland

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,160
Hou and the password is asked Clinton

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,160
because someone thinks that's funny

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,459
dinner tonight it's on this level all

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,690
the way at the other end at the

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,129
boulevard room if you look at your

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,350
registration page you'll see a snake

00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,359
that means you've got a dinner ticket if

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,510
you don't have a sink and you think you

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,410
should have a snake let me rephrase that

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,400
if you if you don't have a dinner ticket

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,199
and you think you should have a dinner

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,199
ticket please come to registration desk

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:38,550
so our lunches are uncoated up and down

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:42,000
grey Street we've got some deals with

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,889
some of the venues up and down grey

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,320
Street and we'll be adding those details

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:52,919
to the wiki this morning make sure you

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,660
get to the plenary sessions on time as a

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,900
slight inducement to that we've got a

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,820
few little prizes and gives away when we

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,150
call out the names you've got to be here

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:09,539
if you're not here you've lost so be

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:12,620
here on time pretty please so when

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:16,139
you're organizing a conference the

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,020
community sort of gets solidified and it

00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,479
means that for a couple of days the

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,120
community instead of being out in the

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,380
aether on a mailing list it is given

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,430
sort of physical presence and form and

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,560
it's really important for the conference

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:38,970
organizers to try and embody everything

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:42,930
that the community stands for so we've

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:45,060
tried really hard to reach out to

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,680
different groups I'm happy with the

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,810
amount of work we've done I'm not

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,550
entirely sure if I'm happy with all of

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,250
the outcome but in the spirit of

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,280
diversity and inclusion I would like to

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:06,320

welcome to South Brisbane in the

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,979
language of the thurible people when we

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,680
do a welcome to country that is done as

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,870
a blessing of the gathering and soul but

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,120
i generally pinch a little bit of that

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,659
time to just tell people look a little

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,789
bit more Mob we were documented as being

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,659
extinct on the verge of extinction way

00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,949
back in 1860s and one small family

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:22,169
survived the impact of European

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,900
settlement upon our ancestral homelands

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,750
our ancestral homelands is between the

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,729
lower river in the south and north

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,560
almost to the glasshouse mountains is

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:36,479
placed called a limber up there a little

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,879
bit creek and inland as far as model the

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,439
thurible ancestral homelands did not go

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,629
to Ipswich that's another group the

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,139
reason I'm standing he was due to the

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:51,089
goodwill of aid I suppose one of the

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,089
pastoralists of the day's bit of us

00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:56,729
philanthropist he created a safe place

00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:59,270
for aboriginals because I here in the

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:03,419
settlement back in the 1830s and 40s

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,819
there's a lot of conflict and up their

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,909
native police I said had the strong and

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:13,439
and I think the diminishment of a lot of

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:16,649
our our population so that's a bit of a

00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,870
sad history but come to terms with it

00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:23,449
got to get on and live with look to the

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,759
future so we feel truly honored and

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:29,550
really appreciate the organizers of this

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,379
event giving us the opportunity to share

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,130
a little bit about our history with the

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:37,529
broader community suppose most

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,919
indigenous groups don't even get that

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:43,640
opportunity no it's mainly those who

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,079
come from city areas or things like that

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,440
the odd festival we have the bush

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,640
somewhere we might get that as well so

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,040
thank you for having us and I'll do the

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,690

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:22,610
