	                              so yes I'm Tiffany Ashley Bell the                               executive director and founder of the                               Detroit water project um so essentially                               last year I read about how                                       people here in Detroit robots have to                               experience life without running water if                               you live here you're part of your                               probably aren't very familiar with this                               but this is lateeya lateeya is a single                                grandmother here in Detroit and she has                                been a caretaker here for the last                                   years or so she's raised he's a                                grandmother and stuff like that but this                                time last year she had to go in medical                                leave Susan health issues and stuff like                                that and that be all fine except for                                this was unpaid medical leave and she                                had grandkids she had to take care of in                                addition to three other kids that were                                not hers that she adopted because her                                best friend died and so because she                                couldn't you know she wasn't paid for a                                medical leave and stuff like that she                                couldn't afford rent or basic utilities                                like water but it turns out though that                                over                                                                   united states experienced the same thing                                where people have problems pretty much                                to understanding how their to afford                                their water bills and utility bills from                                one from from one month the next and i                                found out about this like i said last                                year is a Code for America fellow                                working with the city of Atlanta on open                                data and procurement but I read about                                this in the Atlantic with people here in                                Detroit having to deal with how they're                                going to pay the water bill when they                                don't have jobs and things of that sort                                and the city was not exactly doing much                                to help people out with that sort of                                thing I thought that's pretty crappy you                                considering i was walking around in                                atlanta city hall that time and just saw                                the workings of city hall and what they                                thought of people and policy and stuff                                like that now that was pretty shady that                                a city-run water company is able to just                                turn people off without considering that                                this is a single mother without a job or                                this is someone who is on disability and                                can't afford the water bill and they                                weren't trying to help people                                really and truly um so I wasn't exactly                                content to just sit there and just be                                like oh that's so sad and not doing                                anything about it pretty much a very                                action-oriented person programmer by                                training and stuff like that so I want                                to build and actually do things and so I                                do my normally do when I'm outraged                                about something I usually go to just go                                to Twitter and this time I asked what                                people here Dave and I didn't have water                                and other answers really were moving to                                me so my co-founder at the time she said                                I would help she helped someone with a                                water bill if i could pay that bill                                directly for them and i didn't really                                know what that meant at the time but                                what we turn it into in four short hours                                that same night that we read about the                                story was the detroit water project it                                went from being this really really Jenky                                website here toward it is now but we                                built this in four short hours just                                using bootstrap and Heroku and a bunch                                of other free services like github and                                stuff like that and the goal was to find                                people who needed help with their water                                bills and match them to folks all around                                the world who wanted to just give five                                dollars                                                                afford to help people with their bills                                here and it was not based on you know                                like there being any sort of overly                                special or tight considerations for                                through usual social service programs                                and stuff like that we just want to help                                folks and get their water turn back on                                as soon as we possibly could so I'll                                explain a little bit more like how it                                works a little bit later but essentially                                we match people who need help with their                                water bills to people all around the                                world who want to help which is five                                bucks or whatever they can actually                                afford and we ended up giving this money                                directly to the utility company on their                                 behalf and getting their water turn back                                 on or preventing it from being turned                                 off in the first place and so since you                                 live last year we've paid over two                                 hundred thirty grand and water bills to                                 Detroit and Baltimore just from regular                                 people giving whatever they could to                                 help over nine hundred families there to                                 either oh                                 thank you thank you thanks just out                                 folks out regular people helping regular                                 people and again in Baltimore we've                                 saved over                                                           foreclosure just since februari and                                 launching there because again and we                                 didn't know any of this stuff when we                                 started but you can actually lose your                                 house and your kids over your water bill                                 and I was pretty surprised and again                                 discussed it and a lot of cursing and I                                 found that out um but it's just it's                                 pretty crazy some of the stuff that goes                                 on behind this but a lot of what we've                                 amassed is a bunch of data about people                                 and their situations and especially like                                 their utility data so we want to do with                                 that it's just to design targeted                                 interventions for people over time and                                 help them avoid being in this situation                                 in the future and as a lot of people                                 come to us with different reasons for                                 why they need the assistance so some                                 people may have had a leak that they                                 couldn't afford that sudden spike in the                                 bill or some people long-term hadn't                                 been paying the bill because they didn't                                 have a money the money to she didn't                                 have a job to pay that bill and we think                                 that they're different since there are                                 different root causes for why people                                 don't pay we think that they should all                                 be addressed differently so over time                                 it's not the goal is to just keep paying                                 bills and hope for the best for people                                 but we want to use the data that we have                                 to match people to local community                                 organizations to help them with things                                 like employment foreclosure prevention                                 legal aid and you know leak repairs and                                 stuff like that i mentioned legal aid                                 because we found out that some people                                 they were paying a utility bill to their                                 landlord the landlord wasn't actually                                 paying the bill but they ended up with                                 the shutoff notice ironically and so                                 that calls for legal aid but we also                                 want to just use like common sense of                                 course data science to help utility                                 companies identify people beforehand I                                 mean I've had a conversation with the                                 water department director here actually                                 around the same time last year and she                                 claims she didn't know who these people                                 were ahead of time which I want to be                                 polite and not say certain things but                                 Joe Biden calls that malarkey um                                 you know and because we've seen these                                 things we see in people's data the                                 patterns that says you know this person                                 was paying consistently until six months                                 ago what happened we could reach out to                                 them and when you see those sorts of                                 patterns and just say how are you what's                                 going on and stuff like that we want to                                 do that for utility companies and so but                                 if you live here in Detroit this is                                 probably familiar this is the water                                 department website so what we do when                                 someone applies is we take this we                                 actually go and we take their account                                 number and we scrape all this data from                                 the utility company website and we use                                 that to sort of analyze whether or not                                 they need help and like when you know                                 like I was saying before your payment                                 pattern suggested they may have needed                                 help because I'm people they'll do                                 things like make partial payments when                                 their bills a certain amount or whatever                                 and we can sniff all that sort of stuff                                 out and actually determine if they need                                 the help or not and so we do that and                                 luckily I was a math minor in college                                 and continue this is a computer science                                 major it's so like this is some of my ax                                 my math from around Christmas last year                                 but this is what we use to pretty much                                 help people get really really fast                                 decisions this is not foolproof and so                                 when someone is denied for example we'll                                 go and we'll look at the application                                 ourselves and just say is this actual                                 case of neat or not and this is actually                                 the obligatory it works squeem                                 screenshot um pada yeah and so I mean                                 one of the more interesting and more                                 important things to me know about all                                 this data is just using this to sort of                                 spur people to advocate for themselves                                 and to drive change because one of the                                 more interesting things is that I I                                 didn't know this when we first started                                 but there's just so much public policy                                 that's wrapped around utilities and it's                                 kind of obvious in retrospect but just                                 like some of the effects are crazy like                                 i was saying people losing their kids                                 and their houses or water bills but i                                 want to use some of the data that we                                 have and find ways to anonymize it and                                 things like that and show that to people                                 and help them advocate for themselves                                 and so and at help them ask questions of                                 their leaders here and so one of the                                 things I talk a lot about is                                 this map here and this is actually from                                 this is the older map of ours from                                 around earlier this year like january or                                 something like that and but in july here                                 the detroit city council approved seven                                 a percent rate increase in water bills                                 and i was curious of those City Council                                 members that voted yes for that rate                                 increase how many of them had                                 constituents in our program where those                                 people needed help and so what you're                                 seeing here is this a very rough map of                                 the most dense areas for example or                                 where those City Council members                                 actually voted yes for the rate                                 increases and it's kind of like why                                 we've never made this map public because                                 a lot of like clean up we have to do                                 around it but it's just a question I                                 want to help people here ask and have                                 them go to their City Council members                                 and just say here's this map these are                                 all my neighbors in your district why                                 are you raising rates like why does this                                 make sense and of course they say things                                 like we need to you know protect the                                 financial situation of the city and                                 stuff like that which makes sense but                                 you're doing it off the backs of people                                 that already can't afford bills as it is                                 and so what are you propose to do when                                 you have this many of your constituents                                 in areas that can't pay the bills and                                 it's always think it's interesting how                                 in these two areas like these two                                 council members voted no against the                                 rate increases they don't have as many                                 people as these other folks do but again                                 like the goal is to not keep paying                                 bills it's just too that's a stopgap                                 measure to help people that need to help                                 right away or to help them in the future                                 but going forward what I want for this                                 is just like legislation nationally or a                                 state level or wherever it needs to                                 happen to prevent people from being shut                                 off whether its water or electricity or                                 whatever it is but mostly water in our                                 case if they can prove financial                                 hardship these are not folks that like                                 take their utility money and go shopping                                 and things like that these are folks                                 that actually don't have it as it is in                                 the first place we want protections for                                 them to be able to say like I am                                 actually experiencing financial hardship                                 do not turn me off because there are                                 folks that we've encountered that a lid                                 for like a year or more without running                                 water in their houses and I met people                                 in Baltimore that don't have either                                 water or electricity we're talking about                                                                           nited states of america so-called                                 superpower wealthiest country in the                                 world yadda yadda yadda folks are living                                 like this and I think we can I know we                                 can do better as a country so I want                                 this kind of thing in place but i'll                                 leave you with this i'm actually i think                                 LBJ is a kind of a funny president he's                                 always stayed over people but i think um                                 he talks about the great society and                                 sort of the war and poverty from way                                 back when but there's this quota found                                 from his Great Society speech that talks                                 about poverty and how to solve these                                 sorts of things and the kind of thing                                 that's necessary so he says the solution                                 to these problems and that's poverty is                                 talking about does not rest on a master                                 program in Washington nor can it relies                                 solely on the strained resources of                                 local authority they require us to                                 create a new concept of cooperation a                                 creative federalism between the national                                 capital and leaders of local communities                                 and I think that what we're doing here                                 is just an example of how that can                                 happen and sort of you know greasing the                                 wheels for people to advocate for                                 themselves and work together to prevent                                 sort of the end results of poverty like                                 people living without running water and                                 electricity and when they when they go                                 to work and they have issues that they                                 everybody deserves water if you ask me                                 so human right viously their folks that                                 really disagree with that and I don't                                 really care to hear from them sometimes                                 but and I don't mean it that way but I                                 think of it as even if you don't think                                 that water is a human right it's a                                 biological need so that should protect                                 itself and so I just think that this is                                 a nice way of thinking about that but I                                 mean going forward I would ask that you                                 know don't just say oh this is cool                                 that's nice that you did that but you                                 actually give five or six dollars                                 whatever you can and help someone out or                                 volunteer we always did like legal help                                 or people to talk to people that call us                                 for assistance or whatever or just even                                 happen if you're a developer we always                                 need development talent that's reliable                                 and commit it to help us out and even                                 some of those opportunities or paint as                                 a matter of fact so you know go to                                 Detroit water project org and you can                                 help out that way so thank you                                 you
