	Building Healthy, Anti-Oppressive Workplaces 

Remote work and flexible schedules are a privilege of the tech world. Removing the expectation of everyone working the same hours and allowing workers to choose the times they can best contribute can promote a healthier workplace. Remote work and flexible work both have the potential to remove many of the barriers associated with stricter work environments. This helps people with physical and mental disabilities, caregivers, and others have greater flexibility to feel comfortable contributing meaningful work. But building a healthy, flexible workplace also demands shifting the culture to acknowledge how biases and oppressions intersect with how we view and treat others in the workplace. I will discuss how having a flexible, remote schedule and teammates willing to work together through biases helped me make it through a difficult year and find joy in my career.

	                              hi my name is Elizabeth Mitchell I'm                               originally from Detroit and I'm a                               developer and worker owner at sassafras                               tech collective and I'll talk a little                               bit more about them later but they're a                               small worker cooperative based in Ann                               Arbor and i've been pursuing web                               development as a career for about two                               and a half years and today i'll be                                sharing with you my experiences related                                to diversity in the workplace so let's                                start by silently reflecting for a                                moment imagine a time when you hit parts                                of yourself where were you and who was                                around you at that time and how did you                                feel so just think about the time where                                you weren't yourself and it was because                                the people around you didn't make you                                feel like you could comfortably be                                yourself in that space okay now think of                                a time where you felt at ease and                                comfortable about who you were or who                                you are this can be from your parent or                                your past and what does that place look                                like not advancing Indian okay um what                                does that place look like and who's                                there and how does it how does it feel                                okay so thanks for thinking about these                                questions and we'll come back to them a                                little bit later so at one of my                                earliest tech jobs um I worked at a                                development shop in berkeley michigan                                which is a suburb of detroit and it was                                one of the most diverse teams that have                                ever worked with the group represented                                individuals from many nationalities and                                ethnicities and the owner brought on                                people who he thought were bright and                                good at coding and i think he was an                                asian american business owner and i                                think it was important to him to bring                                on people who had been excluded from                                technology careers based on their                                identity                                and with each new hire that they were                                bringing on it was improving his age and                                gender and racial diversity so despite                                the diversity of this team this was the                                first and only time I've experienced a                                vers racism in a place of employment so                                I'm gonna talk a little bit about that                                um one of my co-workers use violent                                language that specifically targeted                                african-americans am on three separate                                occasions the first two times were                                racial slurs and then the last time                                happened during the work day in front of                                everybody in my workplace and she was                                discussing a recent purchase of a                                handgun um in relation to a neighbor who                                made her feel uncomfortable and the                                neighbor happened to be black and she                                also shared that she found it hard to                                distinguish between her neighbors                                because in her words all black people                                look alike um my coworker who lived in                                the same city that I did which is a                                racially ethnically diverse community in                                Metro Detroit she couldn't see the                                differences between her black neighbors                                because she wasn't seeing those people                                as whole people racism clouds a person's                                ability to see each individual person as                                a whole person rather than a caricature                                or a mono lift and Toni Morrison writes                                that oppressive language does more than                                represent violence it is violence it                                does more than represent the limits of                                knowledge its limits knowledge so in                                encountering moments of oppression I'm                                part of me wants to respond with what                                which is from despicable me or                                ridiculous which is a spell from harry                                potter um but you can't laugh off                                discrimination and violence or wish it                                away my co-workers willingness to use a                                weapon in a violent way against a people                                group indiscriminately based on their                                identity was extremely violent and to                                experience that type of violence in the                                workplace was extremely frightening um                                and you can't shake off that person's                                words and never see that person again                                you could do that if it was someone on                                the street but it's not possible to do                                that at work this is the person that                                you sit across from or that you share a                                room with on a regular basis so when we                                continually tolerate this sort of                                 violence in the workplace in this type                                 of language what it does is it creates                                 conditions for unhealthy workplaces it                                 impacts not just the people groups who                                 are targeted or talked about but                                 everyone else in the room regardless of                                 identity and people of color women of                                 all races and ethnicities and other                                 marginalized groups face a lot of                                 discrimination on a day-to-day basis and                                 tech culture is just a small subset of                                 that like we face it both at work and in                                 our day-to-day lives and so when we got                                 to work we don't want to be in                                 workplaces were reviewed as a character                                 and not seen as a whole person and we                                 don't want to come to work to experience                                 discrimination and oppression no matter                                 how subtle or overt that discrimination                                 might be in the long term places that                                 tolerate and exacerbate discrimination                                 they just won't be places where people                                 can sustainably remain so here's what                                 I've learned from working in different                                 workplaces in tech and it's from places                                 where I thrived at and places where I                                 felt uncomfortable people cannot                                 contribute their best if they are                                 wearing masks and each individual each                                 of us is responsible for trying to                                 remove the masks that we hold in our                                 workplaces and employers have a                                 responsibility to promote places that                                 are not oppressive where people are                                 allowed to be there wholesales so what                                 does it mean to wear a mask at work it                                 means that the part of you the parts of                                 you that you cherish about yourself are                                 things you feel you must hide or                                 suppress if you happen to be Muslim or                                 Christian or Puerto Rican or black these                                 parts of yourself are parts of your                                 identity that you don't need to feel                                 ashamed of and if you work in an                                 environment that makes you feel less                                 than because of your identity it's a                                 place where you're not allowed to be                                 your whole self you are wearing masks at                                 that point additionally you may be                                 wearing a mask if you have flaws or                                 weaknesses that you feel that you need                                 to hide                                 or that if you have particular needs                                 that you don't speak up about you had                                 those things because you see them as                                 vulnerable ax t because they might be                                 made fun of or might be exploited in the                                 workplace if that's happening you may                                 also be wearing a mask at work um so                                 let's think back to the beginning of                                 this talk I asked you to think about a                                 time where you might been hiding parts                                 of who you were when you were wearing a                                 mask so I'm asking to you all I'm only                                 can take a few responses how does it                                 feel to wear a mask at work how does it                                 feel to hide parts of yourself so one                                 person said that it's scary because                                 you're you're worried that you might it                                 might be uncovered um another person                                 said that being discovered may make it                                 so that you aren't being your best self                                 because you're so concerned about that                                 anybody else it also may mean that you                                 might not feel like you're good enough                                 in the workplace because you're worried                                 about being discovered as well um and                                 this person said that it's tiring and a                                 distraction and that you're you're                                 spending so much energy investing into                                 keeping up a mask and one more this last                                 one um it also can be limiting because                                 it you're you're not showing your mask                                 at that point seven I'm sorry I did it                                 alright so we're gonna move on so what                                 does it mean to bring your whole self to                                 work it means that you're bringing all                                 of that you are to the work you do it                                 includes your identity your strengths or                                 weaknesses the parts of you that you                                 cherish in your quirks so how does it                                 feel to bring your whole self to work um                                 a few more responses I can't share all                                 of what you said but but just that                                 you're more at ease when you're able to                                 be yourself when you're able to share                                 that you can build trust and actually be                                 genuine the communication that you're                                 sharing with other people anyone else                                 and I guess what I'm from that is just                                 being able to share the parts of you                                 that you are it might be your weirdness                                 or whatever that gives you the courage                                 to keep being whoever it is that you are                                 in the workplace okay I'm going to move                                 on but I really appreciate that so I                                 currently work for a small company                                 caught sassafras tech collective which                                 is a worker cooperative a worker co-op                                 is a business that is democratically                                 owned by its workers and I think what                                 that means in terms of culture is that                                 each individual person even the people                                 who aren't worker owners at this point                                 they're just prospective members of our                                 group who are considering being owners                                 at up at some point each individual has                                 the opportunity to impact and shape the                                 culture of the workplace so sassafras is                                 not the most diverse company but                                 inclusion matters anti-oppression is                                 being actively um its anti-oppression                                 and also being actively welcoming to                                 marginalized groups is built into our                                 structure in terms of like what our                                 goals are and how we go about hiring                                 that's an important part an important                                 component of our company and there is a                                 there's conflict like there's going to                                 be conflict everywhere regardless of how                                 comfortable the environment is people                                 cause conflict with each other so                                 there's conflict but each person is                                 aware of their own privilege and how                                 that relates to how they interact with                                 people at work and when someone's words                                 and actions cause harm something I've                                 never been able to do before in any                                 workplaces I can talk to that person                                 directly and say hey you said something                                 and it hurt let's talk about this um and                                 also we're able to when there's a moment                                 when someone says something that might                                 be oppressive or counterproductive to                                 save space we talk to that person so one                                 person will go to the person say hey                                 this might make other people in our                                 group feel uncomfortable we need to talk                                 this through and that's that's a pretty                                 amazing thing to do to be able to                                 communicate moments of oppression and                                 actually have a solid real conversation                                 with someone about it and it's an                                 imperfect place with imperfect people                                 and their whole and beautiful and I love                                 working there so before working at                                 sassafras I worked on a team consisting                                 of all white men and me a black woman                                 and I wore a mask most of the time and I                                 laughed at things that were                                 inappropriate and that made me feel                                 uncomfortable just so that I could fit                                 in and the environment was one where                                 people's identities and flaws were used                                 for humor which is wasn't                                 healthy and so I worked really really                                 hard they're trying to prove my worth in                                 a place where I was not welcome so this                                 past January while working at sassafras                                 part-time and then working at that other                                 company full time I started to get                                 really sick so I would be really dizzy                                 and tired and I didn't know what was                                 going on um and it started to impact my                                 mental health so I started like it was                                 like my brain was breaking down so I was                                 getting like really bad anxiety and                                 depression while being very ill at the                                 same time and so one day was so bad that                                 at the other workplace i was at i had to                                 tell my boss hey I'm gonna go home and                                 in that moment I had the most honest                                 conversation I had had ever with that                                 boss even though I had worked there for                                 months and it was because at that moment                                 where my with you know my being like not                                 well my body finding was like hey you                                 don't have time for mast um so I decided                                 to join sassafras full time around that                                 same time and during that time I was                                 still going through some really                                 difficult health challenges but despite                                 these how challenges what made it really                                 easy um what made it easier for me not                                 super easy but was to just have remote                                 and flexible work and also really                                 understanding co-workers so there have                                 been days where I felt too dizzy or                                 physically exhausted to go about normal                                 daily activities my mom was alert but my                                 body was exhausted and so I would depend                                 on how i was feeling I would work from                                 the couch i work from bed i would work                                 for my office at home and having remote                                 work allowed me to contribute meaningful                                 work while being aware of and responsive                                 to my physical limitations so remote                                 work the slides are going to work some                                 remote work is the ability to perform                                 your work from a place other than your                                 employer's primary location so the and                                 then the definition that i have for                                 flexible work is the ability to perform                                 your work at a flexible time of the day                                 or night so some of the things that are                                 beneficial about flexible work are that                                 they allow people to contribute at times                                 that they're most able to contribute in                                 terms of energy focus and distractions                                 like it might just be the best time for                                 the                                 it allows people to pursue other                                 interests and commitments it makes it                                 takes people holistically you're not                                 just your job it allows people to pursue                                 to contribute at times when they're most                                 alert and staggered work in an office                                 may allow people who like the focus time                                 do they get early in the morning or                                 later in the evening which allows for                                 increased productivity and focus so if                                 you know that your office gets really                                 busy around a certain time you're like                                 I'm coming in early and I'm leaving and                                 that that's a good thing for people to                                 do and some of the benefits of remote                                 work are that allows people to                                 contribute in places where they feel                                 comfortable and for people who might                                 experience anxiety it helps reduce                                 anxiety because you're not surrounded by                                 people and so some of the people who can                                 benefit from flexible and remote work it                                 kind of it opens up things in a really                                 big way um that I don't think we really                                 think about like it's beneficial for                                 people with mental illness and mental                                 disabilities with people who have                                 physical illness and physical                                 disabilities someone who experienced                                 chronic illness parents guardians and                                 caregivers if they have that flexibility                                 of time or can work remotely that also                                 is really beneficial to them and anyone                                 who's had a very uncomfortable or                                 traumatic experience specifically in                                 tech having met flexibility if you if                                 sometimes you might somebody might hit a                                 trigger being able to like pull back and                                 say I'm gonna work from home today that                                 really helps so remote work and flexible                                 work we have to see them though as tools                                 you can't just those two things by                                 themselves don't make for a healthy                                 workplace it's being able to see people                                 holistically and know that your                                 teammates are people are whole people um                                 and that everyone is equally valued so I                                 think what's been beneficial is that                                 we're not judging when people use remote                                 work or when people use flexible work                                 everything is the same so I think that's                                 been really really valuable um so that's                                 it for my talk I just wanted to I guess                                 share just some of the things that have                                 really makes a hard year work for me                                 does anyone have any questions                                 it's okay thank you
