Description: 
	Toxic Masculinities, Sexual Violence, and Tech

Incidences of violence in our communities over the past several decades have culminated to create hostile and unwelcoming climates for people who don’t experience the privileges of the majority. While we make concerted efforts to recruit new women and people of color, retention rates are much lower than their white men peers. Centering my talk on sexual violence and gender constructs, particularly contemporary masculinities, I’ll provide specific actions we can take in order to make our spaces less toxic for the women and people of color already in our communities.

also a                               volunteer educator for an organization                               called rape victim advocates who are a                               social service agency that provides                               support on medical and legal stuff to                               survivors of sexual assault as well as                               counseling services to survivors and                                people close to them and education and                                training around sexual violence just to                                add to some of those sort of agreements                                we set at the beginning anyone in the                                room might be affected by sexual                                violence whether it's through our own                                experiences or people that were close to                                so I just like to ask for people to be                                cognizant of that and thoughtful of that                                before asking any questions and making                                any comments again you can leave the                                room at any time and I'd like you to                                take that with you for the rest of your                                life you never need to ask anyone's                                permission to ever leave any room ever                                right and I'll be available during the                                breaks and I'm gonna stick around for a                                little while after the conference to                                answer any questions privately or just                                listen for a little while and just for a                                piece of clarification around language                                I'm reusing the term woman in my talk to                                reference anyone on the gender spectrum                                who's a target of sexism and sexual                                violence and I recognize that that                                includes people who may not identify as                                the word woman and this is stuff that                                I'm still trying to figure out and learn                                from so if anyone has any sort of                                feedback around language I'd love to                                hear your perspective after the talk so                                I want to start by talking about a                                timeline that geek feminism has on their                                wiki it's a timeline of incidence of                                sexism that has happened in geek                                communities our folks who know you with                                this timeline of people taking a look at                                it I'm seeing quite a bit of nods around                                the room so it's a timeline that goes                                back                                                                    see here and includes things like a                                verbal violence                                i sexist jokes shitty things people say                                about other people's bodies and stuff                                like that it includes things like                                stalking and sexual harassment that                                includes things like murder and rape and                                these are things that happen in geek                                communities including texts spaces                                conferences and meet up some things like                                that so has anyone in this room I'd like                                to ask and I don't want to ask you to                                share anything or not comfortable                                sharing of course but if I may could I                                see a raise of hands of anyone who's                                ever experienced something that could                                that could be on this timeline in a tech                                or gaming community so there's a decent                                lot of hands up so a follow-up question                                for folks who did raise their hand or                                any of those any of those incidences on                                this timeline I don't see any hands up                                raised in the room right so did I right                                um so so the link to the timeline is                                here but if you've submitted the thing                                that you're thinking about to the                                timeline at imagine you may know that                                it's on there right but nonetheless I'm                                not seeing any hands up in the room so                                this timeline is significant and it's                                important right because it documents                                some really egregious things that have                                happened at our communities but I want                                us to look at this time lines only a                                slice of everything that's happened                                that's happening and that has happened                                at our communities because we know that                                a vast majority of sexual violence goes                                unreported because rightfully so people                                generally don't feel safe sharing what                                of what's happened to them so this so I                                wanted to look at this timeline and                                think about its timeline but also                                recognize everything that's not on this                                timeline and I want to look at this                                timeline in a few different ways right I                                want to look at this time line through                                the lenses of the layers in which                                oppressions operate and if you're not                                familiar with those layers it's personal                                 and interpersonal so this timeline is a                                 series of real incidents that have                                 really happened to real people that                                 really been perpetuated by real people                                 so the personal and interpersonal                                 Alice's take a step                                 back from that and also look at it at                                 the community level these are incidences                                 that as a community we've allowed to                                 happen and I wanted to question the ways                                 in which as a community we actually                                 perpetuate this kind of behavior to                                 happen taking a step further from that                                 further back from that I want us to                                 connect with the societal level of the                                 way in which oppressions operate and                                 recognize that the things that are                                 happening in our community that allow                                 this stuff that happened that perpetuate                                 this stuff to happen isn't an isolation                                 right it's connected with the ways in                                 which women are treated overall in our                                 societies and if we take it a step                                 further back from that I wanted to look                                 at it at the institutional level and                                 when I talk about institutions I'll talk                                 about things like governments like like                                 the system of academia large                                 institutions in our society that set                                 policies or don't set policies that                                 allow this stuff to happen and again                                 question ways in which our institutions                                 may be perpetuating this stuff to happen                                 and I want to look at in all these                                 different ways because even if someone's                                 not a direct target of this sort of                                 violence of sexual violence in our                                 communities all these incidences add up                                 right all these incidences culminate to                                 create this climate that sends a message                                 to women that are spaces aren't for them                                 there is that they're not welcome to our                                 spaces and that they're not safe in our                                 spaces right and I want us to recognize                                 that we can't talk about sexual violence                                 without also talking about racism                                 without also talking about classism in                                 homophobia and transphobia and all the                                 ways in which power is unevenly                                 distributed between people in our world                                 because sexism and sexual violence                                 exists in parallel with all these other                                 oppressions and are connected with all                                 these other oppressions and we can't                                 talk about one without talking about all                                 the others so I want us to keep our                                 minds connected with all those different                                 ways that oppressions operate in their                                 societies because we're talking about                                 all of them at the same time right now                                 and there's an interesting contradiction                                 here when we look at this timeline right                                 because a lot of us have found our                                 people and putting our people and air                                 quotes                                 I don't know why really but I'm a lot of                                 us have found our people in these spaces                                 right lifelong relationships that we                                 couldn't imagine living without right                                 for a lot of us these tech and gaming                                 spaces are some of the safest places                                 we've ever found for ourselves yet at                                 the same time clearly for many folks                                 these are some of the most unsafe places                                 that they've ever been that's not what I                                 want my community look like right if we                                 want to make our space is safer for                                 women we need to talk about sexual                                 violence we need to be able to recognize                                 it and name it too many varying degrees                                 we need to have a sense about how to                                 support survivors of sexual assault and                                 we need to interrupt sexual violence and                                 that's what I'm here to talk to you                                 about today which is kind of a                                 no-brainer right like you'd have the                                  jerk not to want to end sexual                                 violence in our communities ok so what                                 what gets what gets in the way what's                                 stopping us from ending sexual violence                                 right now at like                                                                                                                              gets in the way well speaking from my                                 own perspective as a sis man our folks                                 familiar with the term sis I'm seeing a                                 lot of heads in the room but just in                                 case sis refers to someone whose whose                                 gender identification matches the gender                                 they were assigned at birth right so I                                 identify as a man i was assigned to be a                                 man at birth write those things match                                 for me so speaking from my own                                 experience as assist man raised in the                                 united states we learned as men we learn                                 to act out and again using men in that                                 broader sense that i referred to                                 referring to women as well at the                                 beginning we learned to act out                                 patriarchy right we learned to act out                                 patriarchy by learning masculinities                                 there are toxic to ourselves and to                                 everyone around us we learned these                                 masculine days that teach us the power                                 is equal to domination to domination of                                 women and this kind of learning damages                                 us it her                                 men you know it it reduces our full                                 humanists to only being allowed only be                                 given be given the space to be these sex                                 and violent machines you know where                                 there's no space for emotion there's no                                 space for vulnerability and it's really                                 isolating and a lot of us learn really                                 similar lessons in pretty different ways                                 because there is no one masculinity like                                 the idea of a universal masculinity is                                  right because masculinity is                                 very by things like race by sexual                                 orientation by gender right because sis                                 men don't own masculinity you don't have                                 to be a man to be masculine dude you                                 don't have to have a penis too masculine                                 right that those two things are separate                                 from each other and it make this                                 distinction between masculinities that                                 are toxic and those that are healthy                                 because masculinity in and of themselves                                 aren't bad right men aren't bad but the                                 ways in which we've learned to value                                 ourselves as human through the amount of                                 patriarchal power the we that we use                                 that we have the wii unwieldy to the                                 world like that's up and that's                                 bad but men aren't bad and those are                                 separate things and in order to end                                 sexual violence when we're talking about                                 the personal the interpersonal the                                 communal the societal and institutional                                 a significant part of ending sexual                                 violence that all those levels is the                                 personal interpersonal part and as men                                 we have to sort of dismantle some of                                 this stuff and unravel this stuff that                                 we've learned that we may be acting out                                 in our relationships with ourselves and                                 with the wider world around us and we'll                                 talk more about that but before you do                                 let's talk about recognizing sexual                                 violence and I think it's important that                                 we know how to define sexual violence                                 because if it's not something that we                                 can define it's not something that we                                 can name as violence it's not something                                 that we can seek justice for and it's                                 not something that we can heal from so                                 recognizing and defining it is a                                 significant piece and I think of sexual                                 violence as being a spectrum of things                                 right all of which are part of this                                 system of domination the system of power                                 and control over women some of the                                 things that you might find on the                                 spectrum is like verbal violence and                                 that's like i said earlier things like                                 sexist jokes misogynistic and hateful                                 speech shitty things people say about                                 people's bodies I have no doubt that                                 everyone in this room can we can spend                                 the rest of this time talking about                                 examples right the people have either                                 witnessed or experienced of verbal                                 violence also on the spectrum is sexual                                 harassment we've already heard people                                 talking about experience of sex for                                 harassment and talks before me today we                                 can think of sexual harassment is any                                 sort of unwelcomed sexual advances and                                 that could be verbal or that could be                                 physical and that could be in person or                                 it could be online right speaking to                                 that I look like an engineer sort of                                 response right it was a song it was                                 online and it's still considered sexual                                 harassment it's typically something that                                 happens in a workplace but it also                                 happened in a group of friends a team of                                 developers and designers because I can                                 happen online it can happen on Twitter                                 it can happen in IRC channels stuff like                                 that also on the spectrum of violence I                                 would include stalking and stalking is                                 considered conduct that makes one                                 reasonably fearful or creates emotional                                 distress it include monitoring or                                 following and we've already heard                                 examples today of things that kind of                                 sound like stalking right and again it                                 can be personal in-person or electronic                                 and I geek feminism's timeline there                                 unfortunately many many many examples of                                 stalking that have happened our                                 communities over time one person was                                 found armed in his car on his way to a                                 woman's house who he was harassing                                 online right so the disclosure of her                                 address not only gave him information                                 but he also had a plan and he was found                                 executing that plan so up a lot                                 of examples on geek thunders and                                 timeline include death                                 let's rape threats along with the                                 disclosure of addresses and I'm not good                                 I'm only going to say one thing about                                 gamergate and that's right now and                                 that's a say that allows the stuff that                                 happened in gamergate falls into many of                                 these categories right and Stocking was                                 a big part of it that's all I'm gonna                                 say about gamergate next on the spectrum                                 is molesting and groping and the legal                                 word for molesting and groping is sexual                                 abuse and we can think of that as any                                 sort of sexual conduct touching or                                 showing any part of the body that you                                 would put under a bathing suit and just                                 for clarity for someone who's under                                    it includes any part of the body at all                                 right and that the piece about showing                                 is an interesting part of the definition                                 of sexual abuse because you don't                                 actually have to touch someone for it to                                 be considered sexual abuse forcing                                 someone to witness a sexual act is                                 considered sexual abuse and                                 unfortunately there are a lot of                                 examples of this on the timeline two in                                 particular groping so many instances of                                 groping in our communities there was one                                 example that happened on stage at the                                 hugo awards do folks know do you want to                                 sort of give a quick summary no okay                                 well it's there's a video on youtube I'm                                 assuming the genders of the people in                                 the video so I apologize so I miss                                 gender anyone but this guy goes on stage                                 to accept an award and a woman is                                 presenting the award there at the podium                                 having some banter back and forth and at                                 some point he just puts his hand on her                                 boob and he kind of his linkers there                                 for a minute and then drops his hand                                 down and then she sort of awkwardly                                 wraps up and walks off stage it was very                                 public the hugo awards right people                                 followed the hugo horse to know what                                 they are uh okay deep breath                                 next up on our spectrum rape the legal                                 word for rape is sexual assault and I'll                                 often use those two words                                 interchangeably and in the state of                                 Michigan I'm from the work I Do's in the                                 state of Illinois I looked up the laws                                 in the state of Michigan of how rape is                                 defined here and it's to find very                                 similarly as it is in Illinois rape is                                 defined as any sort of penetration again                                 with any part of the body you would put                                 under the bathing suit defining a rape                                 is any sort of penetration really                                 broadens our culture's narrow view of                                 what rape is something that happens                                 between assist man and it's this woman                                 and involves vaginal penetration right                                 when we think of rape more broadly as                                 penetration it includes things like                                 forced oral sex that's considered rape                                 it includes things like force                                 penetration with an object that too is                                 considered rape and unfortunately there                                 are instances of rape that are on gphone                                 ISM timeline lastly sexual exploitation                                 sexual exploitation can be defined as                                 the change of sex or sexual acts for                                 basic life necessities so things like                                 food water shelter protection it can                                 also be in exchange for things like                                 drugs or money and sexual exploitation                                 is really like the reducing down of all                                 of one's options to needing to do a sex                                 or sexual act just to survive just for                                 basic life survival so those are all the                                 things that I would consider is being                                 part of the spectrum and again these are                                 all the things that sort of contribute                                 to this climate that I talked about                                 earlier and I want to make a distinction                                 nothing on this spectrum has anything to                                 do with sex right sexual violence                                 doesn't have anything to do with sex                                 sexual violence is about power and it's                                 about control and the difference between                                 sex and violence is consent right                                 because sex is something that people                                 mutually agree to enthusiastically                                 right people mutually agree to before                                 something happens and every step of the                                 way during something happening at any                                 point you know someone could say hey you                                 know I'm up for this let's do it halfway                                 through the like you know what I'm not                                 feeling this anymore it should stop                                 right because I any point the consent                                 isn't given and something happens anyway                                 that's when something crosses the line                                 between sex and violence nothing up here                                 has anything to do with sex I want to be                                 very clear about that so let's talk                                 let's just take another deep breath how                                 folks doing I'm seeing a few nods okay                                 cool so let's talk briefly about                                 supporting survivors if you only take                                 one thing away from my talk today here I                                 want it to be this I want you to hold                                 these three things in your brain just                                 like tuck them away somewhere for the                                 rest of your life anytime someone                                 discloses something that happened to                                 that it could be hard for you as a                                 person who cares about this person who's                                 telling you these things even if you                                 don't know what to say if you don't know                                 how to act just hold these three things                                 in your brain for the rest of your life                                 and save them I believe you it's not                                 your fault you have options I believe                                 you it's not your fault you have options                                 I believe you because the rate of false                                 reporting of rape is really low you                                 wouldn't believe it listening to any                                 sort of news in our world but it's about                                 two to eight percent which is exactly on                                 par with the false reporting rate of                                 other crimes right and the cards are                                 stacked against people so much to                                 disclose what's happened to them just                                 read any comments of any article about                                 Woody Allen or Bill Cosby or Patrick                                 Kane right these are the kind of things                                 that people are up against when they                                 share what's happened to them in my view                                 people have no reason to lie about this                                 sort of violence I believe you and tell                                 them that they that you believe them to                                 it's not your fault because nothing that                                 anybody does asks for this violence to                                 be brought to them none of the                                 responsibility of what happened is on                                 the survivors shoulders is                                 responsibility it's a sole decision of                                 the person perpetrating the violence                                 it's not your fault and do you have                                 options you don't have to know what all                                 the options are you just have to assure                                 them that there are many many ways that                                 someone can process this there are many                                 ways that someone can seek justice from                                 this justice doesn't have to look like                                 the criminal legal system right there                                 are many ways to seek justice from this                                 there are many ways to heal from this so                                 take a look around the room and make eye                                 contact with someone and say these three                                 things with me are people comfortable                                 doing that I'm seeing a lot of blank                                 stares well just look at me just look at                                 me and say these three things out loud                                 with me I believe you it's not your                                 fault and you have options so let's talk                                 about interrupting sexual violence I                                 think I might be a little over my time                                 is um okay just give me a wave if I                                 should stop so when we talk about                                 interrupting sexual violence I want to                                 go back to those levels in which                                 operation oppressions operate what were                                 those levels again                                 yes personal interpersonal community                                 society and institutions and I want to                                 focus today on the first two personal                                 and interpersonal I'm not going to give                                 you strategies on how to jump in and be                                 a savior when you see something that's                                 happening generally I'd like you to if                                 you have that sort of image in your head                                 I'd like you to throw it away because if                                 you see something happening every                                 situation is different it's really                                 important to follow the lead of the                                 survivor you know we know that sexual                                 violence is about power and is about                                 control it's about taking the power away                                 from someone one of the most important                                 things we can do to support someone is                                 to restore that power back to them by                                 following their lead even if that means                                 not intervening when you absolutely                                 believe you should write follow the                                 follow the survivors lead but                                 nonetheless with the personal and                                 interpersonal piece of dismantling this                                 stuff as for the men in the room I want                                 us to think about the ways in which we                                 benefit I wanted to hold ourselves                                 accountable for the ways in which we                                 benefit from sexism and male domination                                 even if we don't know that I need the                                 stuff is happening I don't think it                                 doesn't seem like anyone this is our new                                 ideas                                                                    even if this is the first time you've                                 ever heard of any of this stuff                                 happening our communities I hope I've                                 made it abundantly clear that these                                 things are happening and to an alarming                                 degree by participating in the                                 communities that we participate in like                                 getting whatever it is we get out of our                                 communities friendships work                                 relationships we benefit from this                                 current climate that I've been                                 describing by participating in the                                 communities we participating in we're                                 benefiting from this current climate the                                 more honest we can be with ourselves and                                 more vulnerable we can be with each                                 other about thoughts and moments that                                 were unsure about the stronger our                                 relationships will become the more open                                 our communities will become and the safe                                 Raila become because of it this work                                 very much starts with ourselves in                                 addition to needing to happen at a                                 larger community and societal level but                                 I'd like to sort of leave you with this                                 action
