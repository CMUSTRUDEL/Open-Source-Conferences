Description: 
	Unlocking Economic Participation for Millions of Women

How fixing the world’s broken financaial system can change the lives of marginalized women.

Women all over the world are, on average, awesome at money—they save, pay back loans, and make good financial decisions. However, structural inequalities prevent women from participating fully in the global economy.
Women are significantly less able access to economic services that let them independently better their own lives, as systemic barriers exclude them from formal financial systems.

Stellar.org's Eva Gantz will explore how an open financial network for the world can help fix this. Learn how you can help change the future of women & money.

	                              I'm Eva gantz and I lead global                               community at a nonprofit called stellar                               org and I've been fortunate enough to                               devote the last year full-time working                               on economic empowerment through                               technology and I'm also a freelance                               writer on the intersections of tech and                               social justice so I'm especially excited                               to be here today so today I'm excited to                                talk to you about how we can unlock the                                future of women and money and unlock the                                future for millions of women together so                                i can remember wanting to go to college                                from the time I was about                                             literally counting down the days and I                                my home was never very financially                                secure but I knew that if I could just                                make it to                                                     university I would be okay and I didn't                                worry so much about the academics is                                getting into college but I did worry how                                on earth I was going to pay for all of                                this so I did worry how I was going to                                pay for it because I didn't have a trust                                fund and I didn't even really have a                                piggy bank fund but luckily for me I                                grew up in the United States and I was                                able to apply for and receive a student                                loan and here in the US our perspective                                on debt skews tends to skew a bit                                negative and pictured here are just some                                quotes about debt and how terrible it is                                and our protected tends to see it as                                predatory and something that causes a                                lot of anxiety but if you take a look at                                how access to credit is restricted in                                various communities all around the world                                including here in the US the opportunity                                to get a loan is actually an opportunity                                to independently better your own life so                                I'm not going to say that when i look at                                my negative account balance i'm happy                                about it but I do feel grateful because                                yes I worked                                hard to get my degree I worked hard to                                get the loan and I'm working hard now to                                pay it off but my counterpart in a lower                                income community a woman who wants                                nothing more than to get to university                                and independently improve her life she                                doesn't get that chance today for                                instance a woman named George a nanashi                                pie at                                                                  and becoming a teacher and I'm working                                with stellar org because I believe that                                all of us together can help make the                                financial landscape fairer for people                                like Georgina and others like her so                                right now there are two billion people                                around the world exactly like Georgina                                without access to services like credit                                and even a bank account that many of us                                here probably tend to take for granted                                in fact in Detroit there are one in five                                families who don't have any kind of                                formal financial services and Detroit is                                the second highest rate of unbanked in                                the whole us so if you don't have a                                credit history this means that you are                                basically invisible in the formal                                financial world you can't go to school                                you can't buy a house you definitely                                can't start a business so you're                                invisible and you're stuck so if there's                                two billion people in this situation                                around the world why should we focus                                particularly on women today I want to                                talk about how women interact with the                                larger global economy innovative hacks                                that communities are using to bolster                                women success and most importantly how                                all of us can help change that future                                together so I'm going to make a few                                claims here and I want to be clear that                                these are well-researched claims backed                                by data and respectable sources there                                are sources listed on the slides but I'm                                also happy to elaborate on the studies                                more if you have questions so that said                                women are awesome with money and by that                                I mean that when women do have financial                                decision-making power they tend to be                                really good savers and even low-income                                women and women who don't have a lot of                                steadiness and their finances tend to                                squirrel away at least ten to twenty                                percent                                their earnings and women are also a                                safer bet for lenders because they tend                                 to repay loans more reliably they're                                 also more likely to make equitable                                 decisions for their families and what I                                 mean by that is a woman choosing to send                                 both her son and her daughter to school                                 regardless of the perceived difference                                 in earning potentials and as you might                                 imagine this results in more opportunity                                 for the entire family women are also                                 more likely to invest earnings that they                                 do make back into their families but                                 women's financial acumen is actually in                                 spite of the current financial structure                                 so I want to talk about some of the ways                                 that women are held back in the global                                 economy they're far less likely to have                                 access to credit and twenty percent less                                 likely to have a bank account regardless                                 of other factors across the board so                                 even in formal finance is also limited                                 for women for instance in Kenya forty                                 percent of small farms are run by women                                 but they get about ten percent of the                                 small loans this is old quote that                                 Ginger Rogers did everything Fred                                 Astaire did but she did it backwards and                                 in high heels when it comes to the                                 global economy women are dancing                                 backwards in high heels so they're                                 basically succeeding in spite of                                 restrictions imposed on them so let's                                 take a look at what that actually looks                                 like what i mean by dancing in high                                 heels in a global economic sense so i'm                                 going to run through a couple of the                                 most widespread barriers don't feel like                                 you have to remember them all just try                                 to imagine what would happen if all of                                 these things were stacked against you so                                 we're going to often need a male                                 relatives permission to even open                                 account and oftentimes the account                                 that's opened actually isn't ever used                                 by the woman so this is true with fifty                                 to seventy percent of loans on the books                                 in pakistan for women women also                                 frequently don't have land owning rights                                 so in terms of putting up collateral to                                 get a loan they're frequently not able                                 to do so and this is true in Burkina                                 Faso Nigeria and Zimbabwe just to name a                                 couple of countries women also tend to                                 have limited mobility rights                                 and you may have heard that this is true                                 in Saudi Arabia with women driving but                                 there was also a recent incident in the                                 United Kingdom where women in a small                                 religious sect in North London were not                                 able to drive their children to school                                 and this was in                                                        world there is consistent lack of                                 mobility so if you can't even get to a                                 bank account you certainly can't open                                 one women also tend to not have formal                                 IDs as frequently as men do all around                                 the world and again if you don't have                                 some kind of verifiable identity it's                                 near impossible to get a formal                                 financial service women also just face                                 greater challenges in getting education                                 all over the world and one of the most                                 insidious but least talked about                                 obstacles to finance for women is                                 domestic financial abuse and just to                                 give you an idea of how prevalent this                                 is one in three women around the world                                 will experience emotional abuse from a                                 partner and ninety-eight percent of                                 those relationships will experience                                 financial abuse and that just means                                 withholding access to a bank account                                 forbidding someone to open an account                                 restricting access to money and this                                 kind of restriction can have devastating                                 consequences on a woman and her whole                                 family including the ability to leave                                 that toxic relationship so all these                                 stacked factors stacked together mean                                 that women simply can't access formal                                 finances often but i believe the women                                 can have access and i'm definitely not                                 alone communities all over the world are                                 figuring out these innovative ways to                                 get around the formal finance                                 restrictions for women and one such way                                 is called microfinance raise your hand                                 if you've heard of microfinance oh wow                                 awesome okay cool so I'll skip a lot of                                 the education but as a refresher it                                 basically just means lending in smaller                                 than traditionally thought of amounts                                 for entrepreneurs and these are                                 typically easier to get than a                                 traditional loan so a little history                                 micro-fine had started with dr. Muhammad                                 Yunus in a Bangladeshi village where he                                 started experimenting with lending                                 to very poor women and it ended up being                                 so successful that it's spread all over                                 the world so I want to share a story                                 about a real person a real woman who was                                 able to achieve a dream via micro                                 finance that she wouldn't have been able                                 to achieve without it so this is Devi                                 and she's                                                              Nepal and Debbie took out an initial                                 loan of the equivalent of about                                        dollars and with that loan she built a                                 thriving beauty supply shop and when                                 that succeeded she took out another loan                                 and then a third and her latest venture                                 is the chick business and she raises                                 these chicks and sells them for profit                                 in the market so Debbie was able to                                 achieve this thing that she'd always                                 dreamed of doing and in her own words                                 when a woman owns a business she's kept                                 in the decision-making circle of the                                 family so this is awesome but would                                 everyone in Debbie's village be able to                                 start a business if they wanted can                                 everyone get microcredit who needs it                                 data from the World Bank which suggests                                 that this is not the case so                                             people have been served by microfinance                                 and I want to say that that is is huge                                 it's amazing but if you look at it as a                                 fraction of the larger two billion                                 unbanked you can see that there's still                                 a huge opportunity for growth so how can                                 we help solutions like microfinance that                                 are already happening on their own scale                                 faster what kind of technology can we                                 use the stellar is an open financial                                 network for the world that basically                                 helps solutions like microfinance scale                                 and it does this by providing free to                                 low-cost infrastructure the backend for                                 local services to build on top of so                                 microfinance institutions are already                                 getting excited about this open free                                 network supported by a non-profit and                                 they're building software so for                                 instance this place in Nigeria called a                                 Radian a software company is building                                 something that makes transactions really                                 simple in between these different                                 microfinance institutions and the reason                                 this is needed                                 it's frequently these transactions take                                 place literally on a bus a physical bus                                 ride so they load up the cash drive                                 about                                                                    physically so it's costly it's sometimes                                 even dangerous so they're really excited                                 about plugging into this free open                                 network so an open financial network in                                 itself can also help women opportune or                                 succeed simply just by virtue of the low                                 transaction cost seamless international                                 payments and near instant transactions                                 and those benefits could be the                                 difference that helps a female own                                 business survive so we've talked a bit                                 about the tech area I'm sorry the social                                 implications of what an open network for                                 money could do but what does this                                 actually look like what does it do and                                 what's under the hood and pictured here                                 is a pug with its head tilting cuz                                 that's you know that's how people                                 usually feel when they hear about it                                 first so under the hood stellar is the                                 first of its kind distributed                                 decentralized peer-to-peer network so                                 it's basically accessible and open and                                 free for absolutely anyone to use and                                 you plug into it and you can transact                                 with absolutely anyone else on the                                 network and it's instant in any currency                                 and free so this means that I could send                                 you dollars and you could receive it in                                 pounds in just seconds and these multi                                 currency transactions are powered by a                                 peer-to-peer distributed marketplace                                 that's baked in at a protocol level so a                                 little bit of the architecture of how                                 the network works the base layer the                                 stellar network itself is made up of                                 these distributed to centralise nodes                                 that talk to each other and they all                                 agree on a distributed I'm sorry and                                 agreed upon database and they all store                                 this database and stay in sync with each                                 other via consensus algorithm called                                 stellar consensus protocol it's pretty                                 new it came out this March happy to                                 point you to resources on the                                         white paper or the graphic novel that                                 explains it in sort of a more accessible                                 way                                 but for now let's just say all these                                 nodes agree with each other so that is                                 the stellar network and that is it                                 everything else is an app or a service                                 built on top to let people interact with                                 the protocol so next up our gateways and                                 these are entities that actually get the                                 money onto the network so they accept                                 deposits and record those digitally on                                 the network and any license money                                 service business can be a gateway so                                 mobile money provider a microfinance                                 institution a bank accreditation they                                 can all join and again it's free and not                                 permissioned in any way all right                                 clicker so the final level is users and                                 services that are built on top of the                                 network or accessing the network through                                 these gateways or directly from the                                 nodes and entrepreneurs local people at                                 local financial entrepreneurs and                                 innovators can build their own services                                 at a local level and this is important                                 because the people who are going to be                                 using a financial service or any service                                 for that matter should be the same                                 people who are building it so if you                                 think that this architecture looks                                 suspiciously similar to how the internet                                 works you would be right because we need                                 financial infrastructure to behave more                                 like the Internet take a minute to                                 imagine all of the accessibility and                                 innovation that the Internet has brought                                 to global communication just person to                                 person all over the world and imagine if                                 that could come to money so we've talked                                 a bit about how a stellar can help                                 solutions like microfinance scale to                                 help provide not well served communities                                 with the credit but couldn't an open                                 free financial network do more yes so                                 simply put stellar unlocks potential one                                 such innovation that the network can                                 bring about is for remittances which are                                 essentially cross-border payments                                 person-to-person not corporate so the                                 remittance market is                                                     in a single year and last year                                 we spent forty four billion just on the                                 fees so just fees wasted loss just                                 moving our own money around and these                                 came out of the pockets of some of the                                 world's most the people who need it most                                 people who are working and trying to                                 send money home to their families so our                                 co-founder of stellar org Joyce Kim                                 spoke at the UN on how stellar can                                 unlock remittances through this                                 peer-to-peer distributed marketplace                                 where international payments are free                                 instant and happen at a protocol level                                 stellar also can unlock savings so for                                 instance right now a non-profit in South                                 Africa is building a wallet for young                                 girls and women to save right from their                                 phones so we're probably familiar with                                 mobile money in the sense of you know                                 square cash or paypal this would work                                 somewhat similarly but the girls could                                 save in local south african rand and                                 airtime minutes right from the same                                 wallet and these wallets are all free                                 because it's also a nonprofit serving                                 them so the really cool thing about this                                 is the end goal is not savings it's been                                 proven that women and young girls who                                 are able to save formerly stay in school                                 at least six months longer have better                                 health outcomes and participate more in                                 the global formal economy when they grow                                 up so this isn't just about savings it's                                 about improving their whole lives one of                                 the coolest things about stellar in my                                 opinion is that it unlocks a network                                 effect so once you're plugged into the                                 network like the internet you're                                 connected with every other institution                                 and person on the network so keeping all                                 of this potential for global change in

       access to these services all around the                                 world decrease poverty and people living                                 longer and more self-directed lives                                 okay so we're going to move it right                                 along and say that you can get involved                                 by joining our communities you can build
