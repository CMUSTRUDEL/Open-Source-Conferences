Description: 
	Invisibility Blues: On Advocacy and Activism in the Age of Kickstarter

In this presentation we discuss advocacy writing and multimedia work done through the Not Your Mama’s Gamer’s blog, podcast, Twitter, and other social media platforms, and we do so via the specific (something) of the Invisibility Blues project, from inception through funding and the early stages of production and response.

We will look at the original series of posts on the history of racist imagery in animation and the upcoming video game, Cuphead, as a catalyst for a larger project that became Invisibility Blues, a video series that looks at race and racial representation in video games. The speakers will discuss how they conceived of the Kickstarter project that is ultimately funding the series, reactions to the Kickstarter and the videos themselves, and how they see the Invisibility Blues project affecting the games community directly and indirectly.

Ethical, advocacy-focused communication is essential in a world dominated by new media and social media, and with the particular intricacies of discussing and demonstrating issues in gaming, video is imperative to engage with a medium that is relies on interactivity. It makes available the kinds of writing and inquiry that were previously inaccessible to many, and that access is a necessary action that inspires further action. As academics, we are in a unique position to make our work relevant to the communities we serve through fighting for positive social change. Through NYMG we have done and continue to do this work, creating an organic nexus between the overlapping worlds of gaming and social advocacy.

                        looking at Grayson we're short                                presentation and video games or that is                                currently looking at racing version

                             started from what we thought was a                                little bit was fairly benign it started                                with a post that I had made on the on                                the nine-month your website about                                picking anything pixels and which I've                                looked at a game that was announced at                                e                                                                     now at lo the National the first time in                                                                                                        but I wasn't specifically at the flesh                                that was that was debuted play                                       talked about the fact that the animation                                was according to the developers                                themselves inspired by the animated                                shorts from Disney in the                                           might see me animation daily in the                                                                                                    census big work so i wrote a post that                                talked about the history of this new                                style of animation as well as my                                personal reaction to the fleet at the                                NCAA and it's really important to note                                that it was definitely her personal                                reaction to frame in that way and we                                have to talk about that let's go to the                                next slide because we all have different                                associations with these kinds of content                                and                                the comparisons issues drawing and the                                piece this is from the game cup head                                machine reference this is obviously from                                what did the older nation we have other                                images from the older animations there's                                a small on the screen and I'm sorry for                                that but the entire piece was Frank and                                when I saw this I felt this way it                                acknowledged the passion that had gone                                into games the hand-drawn game for                                trying to replicate techniques from the                                                                                                        with that undertaking even an interview                                when you talk to people talk to studio                                in DHR there is a lot of engagement with                                the school that materials with the                                associations with it and that's what Sam                                talked about it her piece that was so                                cal no better not happen naturally                                obscene as calling for a ban without                                censorship of the game yes so Holly                                others went out i watch this unfold                                because i'm also off the person who                                monitors any mentions of us that happen                                to come up on-site support an like                                reddit we both want to blog comments but                                i usually do the wider checking because                                of all i'm always glued to my phone and                                everything else and it started very                                slowly with some comments on the blog                                very long comment arguing everything                                from the technicalities of the art style                                to how dare we speak out about our                                feelings                                cares about feelings only facts matter                                and the fact is this is a game and it                                 came can't inherently racist or anything                                 else Annie Turgenev art style it started                                 there and then it moved to reddit there                                 were these three threads ando three                                 different drives on reddit and different                                 subreddits within a few days and from                                 their Twitter and then to                                                got to                                                                  me to watch what was happening because                                 they were starting to post stamps name                                 and her university affiliation and                                 things that they can do to maybe think                                 about getting fired and at the same time                                 a friend of mine was going through                                 something similar in Toronto and there                                 had been a campaign was undertaken a her                                 department received over a hundred phone                                 calls about how because she had said she                                 was a feminist she shouldn't be a                                 university professor so it began to be                                 very concerned about this but instead of                                 stopping we did something else because                                 luckily or unluckily York however we                                 want to see it we were also going                                 through in our rhythmic geographical                                 area will start to call the flood of                                 biblical proportion and Alicia I                                 remember when I flooded out of their                                 home so they crawl staying with me a                                 one-time seven um I talk to you about so                                 I try not to use mines because then i'll                                 definitely everyone well solely shaker                                 family were actually staying with me                                 while we were waiting for the water to                                 recede so we kind of sat down at my                                 dining-room table and said what can we                                 do with this point and the answer was                                 let's see if we can make it worse so                                 okay so the listening food committee                                 works so we said let's do a response to                                 the responses that we've had thus far so                                 we sat down and we made a video that                                 will                                 animation style not only a couple of                                 other games that had used similar styles                                 without importing with it the racism                                 that was inherent in the                                                 shorts not make note that upper twenties                                 for five years we've made dozens upon                                 dozens of videos not an insane I've been                                 making videos for not robbers game                                 versus                                                                  this point and with this game that it                                 seemed to bring a record held down right                                 so I know I was to tell you talking to                                 my butt because I was at her house                                 because we were together we were                                 watching all this unfold thought you                                 know Sam's arguments are actually being                                 ignored so let's go down and put the                                 footage side by side with what we're                                 seeing and what we're experiencing and                                 she gave me a little bit of a lesson in                                 the older animation I wasn't as familiar                                 with some of these things as she was so                                 we said enemy love them hey let's make a                                 video let's put it together and try to                                 bring this back to argument or debate                                 rather than a series of accusations                                 about who feels what when what how                                 they're they're permitted to feel so we                                 made this video we posted in two days                                 after the original post on jun                                           i'm just going to play a little bit of                                 footage from if i can get it near the                                 end not that way on this other game that                                 we found coal fire chariot crazy hotel                                 and this was also done in a                                    animation but if you'll notice you have                                 you hunted fast wordage a little bit                                 it's really hard to keep your videos in                                 present ahead of time so Ron struggle                                 bus with that I they the creators of                                 this game try to make something that was                                 a little bit different the main                                 character here cherry is d sexualized                                 from some of the representations of                                 women and the older style animations if                                 you can advance it just a touch to the                                 pictures a lot of those ideas that were                                 seeing some arms is troubling or have                                 more associations of the older animation                                 files here in contemporary world have                                 been removed or stripped away a lot of                                 the characteristics de-emphasized so                                 that there's not as clear a correlation                                 and not as many caricatures while still                                 mimicking the style so we wanted to                                 present this game cuphead we're the                                 creators we're doing something really                                 beautiful but not engaging with some of                                 the things that came up and we're not                                 the only one to raise these objections I                                 skip that slide more time but other                                 people have talked about it and here's                                 another game doing something similar                                 where they didn't have that conversation                                 and those thoughts did go into it and                                 that's the point that we wanted to make                                 you can pay a wash to something and you                                 can build something while still                                 acknowledging that our world has changed                                 and is hopefully continuing to change                                 with the better so at that point we got                                 very interesting because not only did                                 that in response to it like our hummus                                                                                                        were doing and this is actually one of                                 the warmth of nine of the comments of a                                 lot of them never saw thematic day we                                 haven't been neither this would be not                                 even put a lot of things delete I mean                                 anything if they were threatening mark                                 I've been archived them in a five that                                 we keep because that's what most of us                                 would work on an Internet and do this                                 kind of work do because in case you ever                                 need to submit that was somewhere we                                 need to have them and it is interesting                                 to watch these kinds of things happen so                                 Alicia and I are not made this joke                                 wasn't maybe I should tell this joke and                                 I was there so what we do next and I was                                 like yeah because it's almost kind of                                 like were like well that last thing that                                 you just killed what would you next is                                 he would so but the interesting thing                                 here is that in addition to the comments                                 that we've got that were angry and                                 threatening also got a lot of positive                                 reinforcement from the immunity from                                 game developers from game designers and                                 mothers dollars every day even Disney's                                 about you were like yes this is exactly                                 what we want to be paying attention to                                 these are things that are interrogating                                 too long good work we want to see more                                 and that those are conversations that                                 need to be happening and so we because I                                 was still her house we sat down and said                                 what do we want to do at this point do                                 we want to just hope it goes away and                                 not deal with it or do we want to keep                                 doing it and I said you know                                 a couple of days to make that first                                 video we could make some more and say                                 I'm not just look on her face that I've                                 never seen before we'll probably never                                 see again her eyes just got so big and                                 she said I've always wanted to do that                                 because I don't know what if I signed up                                 for but then I'm going to get to play                                 and that's where everything began to                                 change and we decided because what we                                 needed needed your things hardware we                                 needed software you need to have access                                 to more games for both of us that you                                 know it's while it's easier for me to do                                 because this is my research fraction                                 just haven't read that right they have                                 access to these past days so we had to                                 think about all of the things that we                                 would need will begin to make a list and                                 a possible budget and within that budget                                 but not only include those items                                 hardware software hundreds of games but                                 also time because it's just us and as we                                 began to talk about it and as we                                 launched the Kickstarter soon as we had                                 some ideas about what kinds of themes we                                 might want to do you can begin to think                                 about what we needed we thought we've                                 got to crouch run this so we'll launch                                 we've learned it may be a little more                                 planning before that way ever do it                                 again but we had a pretty solid                                 foundation and base and we said you know                                 we asked for initially for forty eight                                 hundred dollars you said this is the                                 money we need to pay smaller area to get                                 some people to speak with us to support                                 it other researchers maybe who would                                 think people have specialties beyond us                                 beyond the things that we do and for all                                 of the games but we never asked pretty                                 support personnel and we still don't                                 have any everything that we do is just                                 us so that's been a challenge but not                                 only do we have to think and plan in                                 terms of what we needed we also had to                                 think                                 plan in terms of safety because we both                                 have children we both have families and                                 pets and we've watched people swatted                                 Sam as experience to some of that in the                                 past we spent hours trying to scrub our                                 online profiles I put a lot of videos of                                 my children for extended family I had to                                 try to make sure that those were hidden                                 but could still be accessed by people                                 who were not tech-savvy had to make sure                                 addresses you want to list it anywhere                                 had to think about everything that I've                                 ever posted on the internet for instance                                 that I'm very active got a lot of online                                 venues I didn't think about what happens                                 if somebody spends                                                     thinks that I said back in                                              that might impact my career because                                 there are people who do that just                                 because your dare voice an opinion about                                 a video game luckily I guess we were                                 lures no at my other two point I just                                 really didn't we hope I had also had to                                 go through because my mother leaves her                                 phone number and her address listed in                                 everything she's awesome and I really                                 didn't wanna mess myself in the phone                                 book so I actually had to go through                                 these sites and to enough only for                                 myself but to do it for my mother as                                 well who's an old woman who lives alone                                 right and we've seen over and over again                                 that insane people who post these kinds                                 of things on the internet have been                                 calling the elderly parents of people                                 and making threats toward their children                                 and my mother talking to you forgotten                                 how can so I had to go through to do                                 this not only for myself in terms of                                 manually asking that my namely removed                                 from databases but also has made the                                 same for my mother and the other thing                                 that we had to do was sit down and think                                 about what our goal really works what do                                 we want to accomplish with a project                                 like this and it's not enough to just                                 say oh we want things to change we want                                 things to be different we want our                                 children to grow up in a more inclusive                                 environment because that's an amorphous                                 goal what do we want okay so we sat down                                 and talked about it what we would like                                 to see and this is what came about when                                 we talked with the game developers and                                 creators and we're coming to us and                                 saying yes many these conversations as                                 we need more people in those rooms privy                                 to those discussions about right we need                                 somebody to stand up and say you know                                 what maybe we do these engage with these                                 ideas maybe before you include that                                 scene of sexual assault in your gaming                                 to think about what the impact is maybe                                 when you're creating a character                                 generator you need to make sure that if                                 you can have people of color than those                                 men can maybe also have beards that                                 aren't long and straight and we thought                                 about all of these things that we wanted                                 to accomplish and then all came back to                                 just taking a moment to demonstrate here                                 is what we see here's what it means here                                 are the implications that maybe people                                 sitting in these rooms creating games or                                 not thinking of we need to wipe the                                 conversation and so we got funded on                                 august eight and we find it at two                                 hundred seventy percent of our original                                 goal so that was really nice                                 and we're very very proud of that but                                 the hard truth is that still in ten                                 thousand dollars were making eight                                 videos and I all ready to cut the first                                 video which David yesterday I cut seven                                 and a half hours of footage finally at                                 the end down to                                                      learn how to create effects we had to                                 learn to do better sound production we                                 had to learn to our production quality                                 because of course people already                                 comparing what we're doing to what I                                 need Sarkisian does but she has a team                                 you know she's got always future is                                     thousand dollars we raise                                              big difference there but we'd like to                                 show you within our remaining time to                                 very short clip from the video that they                                 you yesterday so you can see what we're                                 doing and what we're about this first                                 video was she finds the place is about                                 character creation engines absolutely                                 thank you for sure that's                                               show the tummy room and if we can find                                 the exact spot I mean we can surely just                                 take a moment to talk about what's                                 happening on the screen so one of the                                 things that we looked at we looked at                                 hair options never made one here is your                                 creation and one of the things that we                                 saw we looked at which five or six games                                 for this video total we included some                                 footage from other games including one                                 that came out several years                                 that in which there was for instance                                 NPCs non-player characters who were not                                 white in the game but in the character                                 creation engine you could only make a                                 white character no matter what you can                                 change your hair color but you can only                                 be the same shade of pale we talked to                                 Sharif Jackson and game looks good about                                 beards because as I mentioned often you                                 cannot make characters who who have                                 short curly beards they have to be long                                 and straight magnificent glistening                                 beards of your support if you get it to                                 play fairly simple at the time ten                                 desires hogs missing sri studies added                                 more facial characters characters is                                 zombies groan and the games were the                                 closest options take these                                            least me and DHEA                                                      may be                                 because the athletes are most dangerous                                 color but that doesn't mean similar                                 options should be available in other                                 character creators well just notice                                 something like I really like it that I                                 just discovered problem with the video                                 over here that's great but some of the                                 things that we noticed where that for                                 instance and this is where we'll wrap up                                 is that there was a lot of rhetoric that                                 was really troubling in the law                                 especially fantasy games like the one                                 black raised in a certain cake doesn't                                 share blood with anybody else they're                                 totally separate so in some of the games                                 in that series was in the old roles you                                 could make only those characters                                 dark-skinned only those people in that                                 particular race and other ones can be                                 sort of dark but when you got them dark                                 but they just look like they roll in mud                                 and it was really troubling to see these                                 kinds of options because you're also                                 limited in your play style and a lot of                                 people according to our research are                                 making characters that are idealized                                 versions of themselves what does it tell                                 those players if when they're making                                 that idealized version that they can                                 only have certain kinds of hair if they                                 can only be certain shades what's the                                 impact and one of the interesting things                                 that we were able to do in this first                                 video                                 and it continued to do as the videos go                                 on is we were able to bring together                                 what is of academics of gamers of game                                 designers to have this conversation in                                 these small                                                           you've seen kind of grown exponentially                                 already because this first video was                                 supposed to simply a character creation                                 and we've already realized that this                                 first video is going to copy video                                                                                                             all the things that we wanted to cover                                 so we find ourselves there ok we're                                 going to make a video now we're okay so                                 it's going to get more and more full of                                 honor but I think that we're going to                                 manage the juicing good and that's what                                 we're here for thank you                                 you
